The length of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever figures show . This was 14 per cent down on a decade earlier when listeners clocked up an average of 11.6 hours a week. The minutes of the BBC Trust’s February meeting published yesterday revealed that director general Tony Hall highlighted the fall. ‘He noted...that time spent listening to BBC radio had dropped to its lowest ever level ’ the documents said. Sources blamed the downward trend on people leading faster paced lives than in the past and a change in habits amongst young people. Lord Tony Hall BBC director general highlighted the decline to the BBC Trust according to minutes of its February meeting . Many people who used to listen to radio as a daily habit now turn to online streaming services such as Spotify for their music fix. That problem is likely to grow as Apple develops its long rumoured streaming service. A BBC spokesman said ‘The number of people listening to BBC radio stations and audience appreciation levels are as high as ever. ‘But time spent listening has inevitably been affected by digital competition and as people ‘tune in’ in new digital ways. ‘ Those ways aren’t reflected in the traditional listening figures quoted here – like watching videos from radio shows or listening to podcasts.’ BBC radio is still reaching 65 per cent of the population each week according to the last set of figures available from RAJAR the organisation which measures radio audiences. But although that figure feels relatively healthy by today’s standards it has none the less fallen by more over the last decade. In the final three months of 2004 66 per cent of people in Britain listened to BBC network radio every week. Lord Hall also used the BBC Trust meeting to note the strong performance of BBC Radio 6 the digital music station which the Corporation had at one point been planning to scrap. ‘He reported that the recent RAJAR figures showed that 6Music had become the first digital only station to reach two million listeners ’ the minutes said. Earlier this month Matthew Postgate the BBC’s chief technology officer said the Corporation would adopt a new ‘digital first’ strategy to help it target a new generation of users. He said the organisation needed to ‘learn lessons’ if they want to ‘compete with organisations that were born in the digital age’.,"the amount of time people spend listening to bbc radio has dropped to its lowest level ever the corporation ’ s boss has admitted.

In every other respect however 29 year old Evans a single mum from Dudley was a winner on Thursday night. She advanced the cause of women in sport no end and gave Doherty the fright of his life in an enthralling and attritional match that will not be bettered in this year s qualifying tournament. Snooker s governing body had been criticised in some quarters for allowing Evans a wild card to compete alongside 127 male players for the right to play in the sport s blue chip event on April 18 something no female had achieved. Reanne Evans shakes hands with Ken Doherty following his 10 8 victory at Ponds Forge . Evans plays a shot during her world championship qualifying match against Doherty . Doherty who won the World Championship title back in 1997 took out the first frame 71 15 . Evans had Doherty in all sorts of trouble before the former champion closed out the game 10 8 . Those critics and the bookies who made Doherty a ridiculously short priced 20/1 on favourite were made to look foolish as Evans had her illustrious opponent on the ropes before finally bowing out 10 8. A gracious Doherty admitted afterwards She played out of her skin. It was good match play snooker and tough all the way through. There was a lot of pressure on this match a different kind of pressure to what I have ever experienced. I do not usually feel sympathy for my opponents but I felt sorry at the end. She played better than me and lost. I do not know how I won that final frame. If it had gone to 9 9 I d have been a million to one to win it. Evans cheered on by her eight year old daughter Lauren at the Ponds Forge sports centre in Sheffield admitted she was exhausted after a match of unfamiliar intensity for her. A 10 time ladies champion Evans had led twice during the opening session before Doherty went 5 4 in front . The 10 time ladies world champion collected just GBP400 as prize money for winning the title in 2013 and this was a completely different environment against a player who beat Stephen Hendry to be crowned the best player in the world in 1997. It was a struggle. With the experience Ken had I just had to dig in she said. Ken had little runs when he needed it but I could tell he was under pressure. Some of the balls were wobbling in from the first frame. I just could not take advantage in the end. I can play better than I did so there is no reason I can not return and beat Ken or even players above him. I have the women s game on my shoulders. I just hope I get some help and am allowed to play in more big tournaments to give me experience. Next week I will playing the ladies in the club again. It s a lovely club do not get me wrong but I do not think many ladies could give Ken a game. I think I would have won if I d taken it to 9 9. The presence of television crews and snooker star Ronnie O Sullivan underlined what a big story Evans participation was. Evans eyes up her move during an enthralling game with Doherty in Sheffield . She lost the first frame convincingly but the nerves did not show after that. She reeled off three frames in a row led 4 3 and once Doherty went in front pegged him back to 5 5 and 6 6. The Irishman now ranked No 46 in the world started to look his 45 years. He sat down at every opportunity while Evans often stood while he played. She had the confidence to play right handed or left handed as O Sullivan sometimes does. The key frame was the sixteenth. It lasted 45 minutes with Evans rattling off the first 59 points and Doherty the next 74. It took Doherty to a 9 7 lead but Evans came roaring back in the next frame. He needed a snooker to avoid the match going into a final frame – and he got it. Doherty now ranked No 46 in the world showed his experience to close out the contest . He has two more qualifying rounds before he makes the Crucible but it s doubtful he will face a tougher opponent. They should let her play in more competitions he added. Evans should certainly use this match to become a leading ambassador for women s sport. Her purple and silver waistcoats drew admiring glances from the swimmers and trampolinists who turned up at the leisure centre as normal as she walked through reception to the basketball hall where 10 snooker tables had been set up. Next time they will know exactly who she is and what she can do.,"at 11 20pm former world champion ken doherty potted a final black and extinguished for now the dream of reanne evans to become the first women player to play the hallowed baize of sheffield s crucible theatre in the world snooker championship.

Offences happened in cars, woods or at the defendants' homes in Banbury .
Lured victims to parties organised on social media and then abused them .
Girls aged between 13 and 16 were exploited by the gang from 2009 to 2014 .",A gang of six men have been jailed for a total of 31 years after being convicted of a string of sexual offences against teenager girls. The offences which ranged from inciting sexual activity with a child to rape happened in cars woods or at the defendants homes in Banbury Oxfordshire. Oxford Crown Court heard how they lured victims to parties organised on social media and then began sexually abusing them. The men were found guilty in March and have now been handed sentences of between three and nine years in jail. Jailed Ahmed Hassan Sule 21 left was sentenced to nine years imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh 22 right was imprisoned for four years and nine months . The girls aged between 13 and 16 were targeted by the gang at under 18s parties organised by Ahmed Hassan Sule 21 known as Fiddy . One child described the parties as a place where girls would go and the boys would choose their targets . The victims who were described in court as emotionally immature were abused from 2009 to 2014. Sentencing Hassan Sule and the others in a court packed with friends and relatives of the defendants and victims yesterday Judge Zoe Smith said You put on charity events to raise money for your football club. This raised your profile among young people in Banbury and you saw yourself as a celebrity. Your friends helped put on these events and you became a sexually promiscuous group not with your own girlfriends but with girls who were young vulnerable and lacking in maturity. The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence who accused the girls of coming forward because it s better to be a victim than a slag . Behind bars Kagiso Manase 26 left was jailed for four years and Said Saleh 20 right was sentenced to four years detention in a Young Offenders Institute . One of the victims told the Oxford Mail When I used to go missing I would swear at my mum and I did not realise I was being really nasty to her. The men put me against my family – it was really clever. When I started hanging around with them I felt important. I had no friends and they were the only people left to talk to. It was a big part of my life and I was scared. I felt like all my friends were making new memories and I wasn t part of them. Calling people slags as the defence did in this case stops other girls from coming forward. I would say to other girls to think about the future. I never wanted to do it. I never wanted to have sex with them but I thought that s what friends did. Thames Valley Police launched Operation Reportage after receiving a tip off about the men s activities and eventually tracked down numerous teenager girls who had been molested. Detective Inspector Steve Raffield from Banbury Force CID said This result would not have been possible without the bravery of the victims. I would like to thank them for coming forward and giving evidence in this case. As in all trials without their testimony we would not be where we are today. As a result young people will be safeguarded while these men will have time to reflect upon their actions in prison.

Both men were to be put before a judge later today. Catania prosecutor Giovanni Salvi s office stressed that none of the crew aboard the Portuguese flagged King Jacob is under investigation in the disaster. He said the crew members did their job in coming to the rescue of a ship in distress and that their activities in no way contributed to the deadly event. Meanwhile the survivors were brought to a migrant holding center in Catania and were very tired very shocked silent according to Flavio Di Giacomo of the International Organization for Migration. Most of the survivors and the victims appear to have been young men but there were also several children aged between 10 and 12 she added. We have not yet been able to ask them about this but it seems certain that many of them will have had friends and family who were lost in the wreck.

Survivors told how women and children died like rats in a cage after being locked into the boat s hold by callous traffickers in Libya . They told yesterday how women and children died like rats in a cage after being locked into the boat s hold by callous traffickers in Libya. Some resorted to clinging to their floating corpses until Italian and Maltese coastguards came to rescue them in the dead of the night. The coast guard meanwhile reported that it saved some 638 migrants in six different rescue operations on Monday alone. On Tuesday a further 446 people were rescued from a leaking migrant ship about 80 miles 130 kilometers south of the Calabrian coast. At talks in Luxembourg on Monday EU ministers agreed on a 10 point plan to double the resources available to maritime border patrol mission Triton and further measures will be discussed at a summit of EU leaders on Thursday.

Relaxed Malek grins on the desk of the Italian coastguard ship next to some of the migrant survivors . Critics say Triton is woefully inadequate and are demanding the restoration of a much bigger Italian operation suspended last year because of cost constraints. The survivors who hailed from Mali Gambia Senegal Somalia Eritrea and Bangladesh were all recovering Tuesday at holding centres near Catania on Sicily s eastern coast. Sunday s disaster was the worst in a series of migrant shipwrecks that have claimed more than 1 700 lives this year 30 times higher than the same period in 2014 and nearly 5 000 since the start of last year. In that time nearly 200 000 migrants have made it to Italy mostly after being rescued at sea by the Italian navy and coastguard. Italian officials believe there could be up to one million more would be immigrants to Europe waiting to board boats in conflict torn Libya. Many of them are refugees from Syria s civil war or persecution in places like Eritrea. Others are seeking to escape poverty and hunger in Africa and south Asia and secure a better future in Europe. Meanwhile Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott urged the EU to introduce tough measures to stop migrants attempting to make the perilous sea voyage from North Africa to Europe. Mr Abbott whose conservative government introduced a military led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum seekers before they reach Australia said it was the only way to stop deaths. Hardline Tony Abbott whose conservative government introduced a military led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum seekers before they reach Australia said harsh measures are the only way to stop deaths . Haunted Surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the Mediterranean Sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the Sicilian port city of Catania this morning . While Mr Abbott s controversial policy has proved successful with the nation going nearly 18 months with virtually no asylum seeker boat arrivals and no reported deaths at sea human rights advocates say it violates Australia s international obligations. His comments came as EU foreign and interior ministers met in Luxembourg to discuss ways to stem the flood of people trying to reach Europe. Outlining his views on preventing the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea Mr Abbott told reporters We have got hundreds maybe thousands of people drowning in the attempts to get from Africa to Europe. The only way you can stop the deaths is in fact to stop the boats he added. Yesterday the Maltese Prime Minister declared a crisis calling for EU countries to reinstate rescue operations. He warned A time will come when Europe will be judged harshly for its inaction when it turned a blind eye to genocide. We have what is fast becoming a failed state on our doorsteps and criminal gangs are enjoying a heyday.

Last week South Korean prosecutors formally charged Kim Ki Jong with attempted murder . The prosecutors office in Seoul said Kim was charged with attempted murder violence against a foreign envoy and obstruction of duty. Kim 55 was a known maverick activist who had been handed a two year suspended sentence in 2010 for hurling a rock at the then Japanese ambassador to Seoul. He has denied any intention to kill Lippert but the prosecutors office said in a statement that the crime was clearly deliberate. There was an intention to murder because Kim used a lethal weapon in a pre meditated crime to attack the ambassador s face and neck repeatedly it said. Kim has told investigators the ambassador was the symbolic target of his opposition to annual US South Korea joint military exercises which he blames for blocking dialogue with North Korea. The annual drills have long been condemned by Pyongyang as rehearsals for invasion. Kim insisted he had acted alone and not on the orders of Pyongyang but prosecutors said they were looking into whether he has violated the South s strict National Security Law banning any act seen as aiding North Korea or promoting its ideology. Investigators have ransacked Kim s home as part of an investigation into Kim s possible links with North Korea. Kim had visited the North seven times and once tried to erect a memorial in Seoul to the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il after his death in 2011.

Peter Bergen: U.S. should rethink hostage policy to increase chances of freeing those held .",CNN Warren Weinstein who appears to have been the only American citizen held hostage by al Qaeda was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike in January. But it did not have to be that way. A senior U.S. official familiar with the handling of the issue told CNN that the U.S. government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73 year old development expert s release either directly to al Qaeda or through proxies in Pakistan. Another senior U.S. official told CNN that Weinstein s capture by al Qaeda made it hard for the United States to negotiate even though proxies such as the Pakistani government have links to intermediaries who might have helped. A senior Pakistani official told CNN that after Weinstein was kidnapped the Pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant Haqqani Network and to the Pakistani Taliban which are both allied to al Qaeda to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about Weinstein. According to the official nothing came of those feelers. The senior Pakistani official says that during the past year Pakistani soldiers who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of North Waziristan near the Afghan Pakistan border where Weinstein was believed to be being held went door to door looking for the American. Nothing came of this search either. On Thursday the U.S. government announced that Weinstein had been killed in a counterterrorism operation in January which is how the government often describes CIA drone strikes. According to New America which tracks drone strikes in Pakistan CIA drone attacks happened in Shawal North Waziristan on January 19 in which at least four militants were killed also on January 15 in Tehsil Ladha South Waziristan in which at least five militants were killed and on January 4 in Datta Khel South Waziristan in which at least eight militants were killed. It is in one of these strikes that Weinstein was almost certainly killed. Lt. Col. Jason Amerine a planner on the U.S. Army staff is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter s office which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of American hostages held by al Qaeda and the Taliban. A plan was developed in the Pentagon to secure the release of Weinstein according to a staff member on Hunter s committee. That plan was to release Haji Bashir Noorzai a prominent and influential member of the Taliban who is in prison in the States on drug trafficking charges in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Berghdal who was held by the Taliban until last year Taliban hostages Caitlin Coleman a U.S. citizen and her husband Canadian Joshua Boyle and Dr. Shakil Afridi who spied for the CIA in Pakistan and was being held in a Pakistani prison as well as Weinstein. It s not clear how far this plan of action went. Amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure. Hunter a California Republican released a statement Thursday saying The only government organization seriously developing options to recover Weinstein and others in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region was within the Pentagon led by war hero Jason Amerine. As an Army captain Amerine led a small detachment of U.S. Special Forces into Afghanistan in November 2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States. The operation was instrumental in helping to topple the Taliban and to install Hamid Karzai as the new leader of Afghanistan. Who exactly carried out Weinstein s kidnapping from his house 31⁄2 years ago in the Pakistani megacity of Lahore has until now not been clear. A senior Pakistani counterterrorism official told CNN that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan or IMU kidnapped Weinstein at his Lahore home on August 13 2011. IMU is an Uzbek terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan. According to the Pakistani official the leader of the Weinstein kidnapping cell was a relative of Tahir Yuldashev the former IMU leader killed in a CIA drone strike in the Pakistani tribal regions in 2009. The initial lead that traced the Weinstein kidnapping to the IMU came from another high profile kidnapping in Pakistan two weeks after Weinstein s abduction. Shahbaz Taseer the son of a leading Pakistani liberal politician Salman Taseer who was killed by Pakistani militants eight months earlier was kidnapped in Lahore on August 26 2011. At the scene of Taseer s kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and SIM card that eventually led Pakistani officials to focus on the IMU group in Lahore according to the senior Pakistani counterterrorism official. The police subsequently arrested three Uzbeks and four Pakistanis who were part of the IMU cell that had carried out the Weinstein kidnapping. Members of the IMU cell told Pakistani interrogators that after they had kidnapped Weinstein they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi conscious among three safe houses in Lahore. IMU members then took Weinstein to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan a semi autonomous region along the border with Afghanistan where al Qaeda and other militant groups are headquartered. There Weinstein was given or more likely sold to al Qaeda according to the senior Pakistani official. Who was Warren Weinstein Weinstein had spent his life helping others working in the fields of aid and development. He held a doctorate in international law and economics from Columbia University and spoke more than half a dozen languages. After his capture the leader of al Qaeda Ayman al Zawahiri demanded the end of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and the release of terrorists held in U.S. custody in exchange for Weinstein s freedom. On September 12 2012 Weinstein appeared in a video produced by al Qaeda s production arm in which he said that the Obama administration had shown no interest in my case. He then appealed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from one Jew to another to intervene. The Obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by ISIS al Qaeda or the Taliban. The key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the U.S. government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them. The CIA for instance is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations while the FBI has responsibility for retrieving American hostages. Often these goals are not in alignment as was clearly the case with Weinstein. The CIA could have exercised more due diligence knowing that Weinstein was almost certainly being held in North Waziristan. There are some solutions for these problems. First families should be granted security clearances by the U.S. government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones. Right now the U.S. government will not communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives do not have the requisite security clearances. Should families abuse their clearances they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones which is a strong incentive not to abuse them. Second President Barack Obama should appoint a senior level person perhaps working in the White House on the National Security Council to oversee the work of the CIA FBI State Department and the Joint Special Operations Command which implements hostage rescues. All these organizations have key roles to play in getting American hostages home. That person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and de conflict any potential issues such as the ones that surfaced in the Weinstein case. Third while the U.S. government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups there is nothing in American policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of U.S. citizens and this should be encouraged even if there is some quid pro quo involved. This is what happened in the case of the American journalist Peter Theo Curtis who was captured by al Qaeda s affiliate in Syria in 2012 but was released last year after the Qatari government intervened in his case. The Qataris have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in Syria including the al Qaeda affiliate holding Curtis and while Qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free Curtis it s unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of al Qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys. Curtis successful release could provide a ray of hope for U.S. citizen Caitlin Coleman and her husband Canadian Joshua Boyle who were captured by the Taliban in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through Afghanistan. A senior American official told CNN they are being held by the Haqqani Network. The Pakistani government has contacts with the Haqqani Network and the U.S. government should ratchet up the pressure on the Pakistani government to secure the couple s release. In captivity Coleman who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage had a child.

Caught after going to police, claiming she was forced out her victim's flat .
She has admitted bedding and robbing 15 men after spiking their drinks .",A thief nicknamed the Black Widow of Facebook who drugged and robbed men after she lured them into bed has been arrested. Argentinian con artist Sofia Davila posted raunchy pictures or herself online and then flirted with unsuspecting men she had contacted on the social network suggesting they meet up for sex. But after meeting her victims the 21 year old from Buenos Aires would spike their drinks and wait for them to fall unconscious before ransacking their homes. Buenos Aires thief Sofia Davila 21 would start chatting to men over Facebook before suggesting that they meet up. When they did she would spike their drinks and rob their homes after they fell unconscious . The 21 year old posted raunchy pictures of herself on Facebook and flirt with strangers she added on the network. She was caught after trying to trick police that she was an innocent bystanders in the robberies . Diego Escalante from Tigre Buenos Aires said he had been robbed after falling victim to the ploy. The 39 year old said We had been flirting with each other for about two weeks and then she suggested we get together. We went to a hotel and had a good time and when she suggested we meet again I did not think anything was suspicious. The next time we met she came to my place and said she d like to drink her own alcohol and poured me one too. I then began to fill ill and passed out. When I woke up my feet and hands were tied and there were two men in my flat taking my TV stereo and other things. After carrying out the ruse Davila went to the police station herself to report the robbery claiming she had been forced to leave the flat by the men and had been powerless to stop them. The thief has been nicknamed the Black Widow of Facebook . She is now awaiting trial after admitting tricking 15 men and robbing them. Two of her accomplices will also appear in court over the crimes . But a spokesman for the police said they were suspicious having received numerous calls from men who had been stolen from after they spent the night with a woman they met over the internet . He said The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. This was the first time the woman had actually shown up herself though but because she matched the description we already had we decided to hold her for questioning. One of Davila s victims said the pair hit it off at a hotel and he did not think have any suspicions when they met up again at his home. He said she drugged him and he woke up with his feet tied and two men stealing his TV . As soon as we spoke to the victim we knew she was the woman behind the robberies and it only took a little while before we had a full confession. We also found that the man had been drugged. Davila admitted to bedding and robbing more than 15 men and is now awaiting trial along with her two accomplices. Argentinian news website DiarioVeloz.com said Davila who worked in PR for a bowling alley told police she was forced to commit the crimes to pay off her debts to a drug dealer .,"a thief nicknamed the black widow of facebook who drugged and robbed men after she lured them into bed has been arrested.

75 per cent of companies don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs .",As Australian Fashion Week comes to a close a new damning report has named and shamed some of the worst clothing brands sold in Australia and their companies for the ongoing exploitation of their overseas workers. Lowes Industrie Best & Less and the Just Group which includes Just Jeans Portmans and Dotti were identified as some of the worst performing companies by The 2015 Australian Fashion Report. Amongst the best performers were Etiko Audrey Blue Cotton On H&M and Zara. The report assessed the labour rights management systems of 59 companies and 219 brands operating in Australia. The 2015 Australian Fashion Report has named and shamed some of the worst Aussie clothing brands and companies for their ongoing exploitation of overseas workers . Amongst the best performers were Etiko Audrey Blue Cotton On H&M and Zara . It found that only two of the companies could prove they were paying a full living wage to the workers in two of the three production stages of their clothing. None of the 59 companies could prove the workers at their raw material suppliers were paid a living wage. Unlike a country s legally set minimum wage a living wage ensures that an employee has enough money to cover the necessities like food water electricity and shelter and still has a little left over for themselves and their dependants. In some countries like Bangladesh where the minimum wage is as little as USUSD68 a month and a living wage is USUSD104 the difference can be made by paying each worker just an additional 30c per t shirt. Lowes Industrie Best & Less and the Just Group which includes Just Jeans Portmans and Dotti were identified as some of the worst performers . The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies do not have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can not be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain Gershon Nimbalker an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid said . A mere 12 per cent of companies could demonstrate any action towards paying wages above the legal minimum and even then only for part of their supply chain the report states. Furthermore 91 per cent of companies still do not know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent do not know the source of all their fabrics and inputs. If companies do not know how and where their products are made then there s no way for them to ensure that their workers are protected. Uzbekistan for instance the world s fifth largest exporter of cotton was notorious for its child labour policies which saw children as young as 10 forced to work in the fields until the government recently improved conditions by renouncing the use of child labour on a systematic basis . Furthermore 91 per cent of companies still do not know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent do not know the source of all their fabrics and inputs the report stated . Gershon Nimbalker an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid told Daily Mail Australia that part of the motivation behind the report was to shed light on how many of the world s 165 million children involved in child labour were employed by the fashion industry. The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies do not have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can not be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain he said. There were 61 assessment criteria that we used to grade the companies that were put together with lots of collaboration with international labour rights organisations. We found all the public information available on the companies public statements anything online and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. The report comes almost two years after over 1 100 Bangladeshi garment workers died when the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Bangladesh due to building safety problems . We found all the public information available on the companies public statements anything online and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. The worst grades basically mean that they have very little public information available about what they are doing to protect workers and on top of that that they have not engaged with our research process. About 75 per cent did engage but one quarter did not. However the report also noted some progress in the industry with companies like Kmart and Cotton On improving their transparency by identifying their suppliers and H&M Zara Country Road and the Sussan Group showing attempts to improve their international worker s pay.,"as australian fashion week comes to a close a new damning report has named and shamed some of the worst clothing brands sold in australia and their companies for the ongoing exploitation of their overseas workers.

His head hit the ground with a 'nasty crunch' and he died 11 days later .
A gang tried to steal cigarettes from the victim's van before he gave chase .
All three have now been jailed, including the man who pushed Mr Prasanna .",Tragedy Prasanna ‘Nick’ Arulchelvam died when he fell from a van while chasing a gang of thieves . A courageous shopkeeper was killed when he made a desperate attempt to stop a gang of thieves who had broken into his van in a cash and carry car park. Prasanna ‘Nick’ Arulchelvam ran and jumped through an open side door of their van but was pushed out and hit the ground as the vehicle sped away. A customer in the Costco car park in Watford where the incident happened reported hearing a ‘nasty crunch’ as the 34 year old’s head hit the ground. Today the man who pushed Mr Prasanna to his death was jailed for 11 years after admitting all he wanted was ‘a few cheap packets of cigarettes’. Mr Prasanna had just finished his purchases when he returned to his silver Transit van and loaded a large box containing 21 smaller boxes of cigarettes in his van. He took his trolley back to a bay and returned to see that the stock he had bought had been disturbed Luton Crown Court heard. Mr Prasanna then gave chase as he saw a separate van speeding off. Prosecutor John Price QC said ‘Mr Prasanna courageously acted in an attempt to stop the driver getting away. ‘With equal determination and with an utterly callous regard for his safety the two men used violence that cost this man his life. ‘Mr Prasanna was forced out but managed to hold onto the side of the vehicle before the door was shut and he fell to the ground.’ A witness said it was as if he had been pushed or kicked away from the van. Nothing had been taken from Mr Prasanna’s van. Last October cousins Patrick and James O’Driscoll were handed jail terms of ten and a half years and seven and a half years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Prasanna. The sentence of Patrick O’Driscoll who was driving the van was later increased to 12 years on appeal. His cousin was in another vehicle at the scene while a third man Michael McInerney 34 was in the rear of the van Mr Prasanna chased. McInerney went on the run after he was arrested in December 2013 and bailed. A European Arrest Warrant was issued but he was arrested in Corby Northamptonshire in December 2014. Today he was jailed for a total of 11 years ten and a half years for manslaughter two years concurrent for conspiracy to steal with six months consecutive from the suspended sentence. Defence barrister Henry Hughes said the father of three accepts responsibility for the death of a man who deserved no harm at all. Jailed Michael McInerney was handed an 11 year sentence after admitting to pushing Mr Prasanna . ‘He will live with the horror of the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. He wanted no more than a few cheap packets of cigarettes ’ he said. Judge Michael Kay QC told McInerney ‘Mr Prasanna was a hard working man and a family man with a wife and two and a half year old son. He is described as a devoted and very loving father and husband. ‘I can’t help but compare Mr Prasanna who was a hard working and lawful citizen with you. What example are you setting to your three children “ . ‘You applied violence to get Mr Prasanna off the vehicle. You pushed him out of the vehicle which began the chain of events that led to his death.’ McInerney from Borehamwood Hertforshire who was living at the time in Radwell Bedforshire appeared via a video link from Woodhill Prison Milton Keynes. At an earlier hearing he pleaded not guilty to murder and not guilty to conspiracy to rob. His pleas of guilty to alternative charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to steal were accepted by the prosecution. He had 17 convictions for 32 offences and operated with alias names and false dates of birth. At the time Mr Prasanna was attacked McInerney was serving a seven month suspended sentence suspended for 15 months for a similar theft from a motor vehicle at a cash and carry in Sheerness in which a man who tried to stop him fell into the road. The day before Mr Prasanna was killed the two O’Driscolls had carried out thefts and attempted thefts at Booker cash and carry stores in Dagenham Chelmsford Colchester and Ipswich. On the Sunday they drove to Radwell and collected McInerney. The Costco in Watford where three men cousins Patrick and James O’Driscoll and Michael McInerney tried to grab cigarettes from Mr Prasanna s van before speeding off in separate vehicles.

In two vans they went to three sites where they stole or attempted to steal from customers at Bookers in Bedford and Luton and at PC World at the Staples Retail Park in Hendon before going to Costco in Watford. Mr Prasanna died on June 6 2013 in St Mary’s Hospital in London 11 days after the attack on him. He came to England from Sri Lanka in 1998 and worked for Tesco as a manager.

Atmospheric winds carried smoke from the wildfires across the Pacific Ocean .
Smoke particles altered wavelengths from the sun, creating a more intense color .",CNN A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan s eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city s skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber colored haze was originating from Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14 it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region according to CNN affiliate KOMO TV. As a result the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens blues yellows and purples KOMO TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person s eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.,"cnn a fiery sunset greeted people in washington sunday.

It would have shocked residents as camels were an alien species .
'They didn't know what to feed it or whether one could eat it,' study said .
Ottoman army used camels for transportation and as riding animals .",Archaeologists have uncovered the complete skeleton of a 17th century camel that was likely used in the second Ottoman Habsburg war. They believe the camel the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683. In a country where cows dominate the rural landscape the discovery in an Austrian cellar shocked scientists. The researchers described it as a sunken ship in the desert . Archaeologists have uncovered the complete skeleton of an alien 17th century camel that was likely used in the second Ottoman Habsburg war. They believe the camel the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683 . Genetic analysis of the beast show that it was a Bactrian dromedary hybrid – a breed popular in the Ottoman army at the time. The partly excavated skeleton was at first suspected to be a large horse or cattle said Alfred Galik a researcher at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. But one look at the cervical vertebrae the lower jaw and the metacarpal bones immediately revealed that this was a camel. The camel was male around seven years old and most likely castrated. The camel was male around seven years old and most likely castrated. Along with DNA evidence the shape of the animal s skull indicated it was a hybrid . The cross breed camel had been most likely used as a riding and transport animal by the Ottoman army during the Siege of Vienna in 1683. Pictured are various views of the camel s metacarpus which is part of its legs . The battle that took place on 11 September 1683 after Vienna had been seiged by the Ottoman Empire for two months.

Ours are treasures unheard of... tents sheep cattle and no small number of camels... it is victory as nobody ever knew before. Galik and his team also said the cross breed camel had been most likely used as a riding and transport animal by the Ottoman army during the Siege of Vienna in 1683. The remarkable find was made during an archaeological dig that took place amid preparations for a new shopping centre in the town. If modern day scientists were stumped by the find it would have been an even greater shock for residents of 17th century Tulln. The animal was certainly exotic for the people of Tulln. They probably did not know what to feed it or whether one could eat it Galik said. While Roman era camel bones occasionally surface in Austria Serbia and Belgium the Tulln discovery was the first complete camel skeleton to emerge in Central Europe. This means that the animal was not killed and then butchered. It may have been acquired as part of an exchange said Galik . The remarkable find was made during an archaeological dig that took place amid preparations for a new shopping centre in the town. Pictured the camel s shoulder blades .

Dean Obeidallah says the actor and the show were right to leave the detail out .",CNN Would you want a TV program about your family history to include details of a distant long deceased relative who had owned slaves Seriously who in their right mind would want to be tarnished by the sins of an ancestor you had no connection to other than a remote bloodline I would not and neither did Ben Affleck who lobbied producers of a PBS show Finding Your Roots to remove any reference to his great great great grandfather Benjamin Cole a Georgia slave owner in the mid 1800 s in an episode that looked at Affleck s family history. Affleck revealed Cole s name Wednesday night. Here s the thing that might surprise many given the tendency of the media to exploit any potentially scandalous material The show s producer Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. apparently acquiesced to Affleck s request because when the episode aired in October 2014 there was no mention of the star s slave owning ancestor. Affleck s attempt to alter the content of the program only publicly became known a few days ago after WikiLeaks released hacked emails revealing an exchange between Gates and Sony Pictures chief Michael Lynton. When Gates asked how he should respond to Affleck s request to delete the material Lynton responded all things being equal I would definitely take it out. And on Tuesday Affleck via Facebook admitted that he had urged Gates to excise any reference to his slave owning relative. Affleck explained I did not want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth. Now Gates has publicly denied that he made his decision about the content of the program based on Affleck s request but it seems likely that he did. After all Affleck noted as much in his Facebook post writing that Gates agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices I disagreed with. And three other celebrities profiled on the series last season were shown to have been related to slave owners. So it s unlikely that it was simply happenstance that it left out any reference to Affleck s familial slave ownership connection. In any event PBS has launched an internal review to determine if the show violated its own editorial standards. Whatever the results of the review Affleck and Gates did the right thing. Let us be clear Finding Your Roots is not an investigative news show it s an entertainment program. In fact as Affleck noted much of the material is provided directly by the celebrity being profiled. It s not 60 Minutes but more in the nature of a sophisticated profile of celebrities using their marquee names to attract viewers. There s not even a hint that Affleck strong armed the producers or made any type of threats against them if they included the information. In the emails between Gates and Lynton which they presumably believed at the time were confidential and would remain so there was no mention of undue pressure by Affleck. Instead Gates simply noted that Affleck asked us to edit out something. After the emails were revealed Gates issued a statement saying Ultimately I maintain editorial control on all of my projects and with my producers decide what will make for the most compelling program. In the case of Mr. Affleck we focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry including a Revolutionary War ancestor a third great grandfather who was an occult enthusiast and his mother who marched for civil rights during the Freedom Summer of 1964. My view would be different if Affleck had a history of uttering racist remarks or engaging in racist conduct. That would have made the information truly newsworthy. But instead we have a man known for championing progressive causes which I am sure made him even more acutely sensitive that some on the right might possibly use this information against him in the future. Perhaps that s what Affleck meant in his Facebook post when he wrote that this information made him feel vulnerable. Affleck has noted that he regrets asking PBS to not include information about his distant relative. That s a nice gesture but it was not needed. Affleck had every right to ask for the information about a long deceased distant relative to be left out of the show. And PBS had the choice to include it or leave it out. I applaud PBS for doing the right thing at a time when media outlets rarely show any restraint on the lives of people in the public eye.,"cnn would you want a tv program about your family history to include details of a distant long deceased relative who had owned slaves seriously who in their right mind would want to be tarnished by the sins of an ancestor you had no connection to other than a remote bloodline i would not and neither did ben affleck who lobbied producers of a pbs show finding your roots to remove any reference to his great great great grandfather benjamin cole a georgia slave owner in the mid 1800 s in an episode that looked at affleck s family history.

Pair wanted over major smuggling ring, but are hiding in lawless Libya .",Wanted A police e fit image of millionaire people trafficker Ermias Ghermay who is thought to have made GBP72m with his accomplice Mered Medhanie from smuggling migrants in the last two years . Two millionaire people traffickers have been heard mocking the migrant boat disasters that have resulted in thousands of deaths in the Mediterranean it has been reported. One of them an Eritrean called Mered Medhanie also known as The General was heard laughing on a police wiretap about overloading migrant ships a problem that causes them to capsize. Medhanie 34 who is based in the Libyan capital of Tripoli is said to have boasted They say I put too many aboard but they are the ones who want to leave in a hurry. A second trafficker Ermias Ghermay who is thought to have made GBP72million with Medhanie from smuggling in the last two years also showed callous disregard for the plight of his customers . He was heard declaring last summer They organised another trip a few days ago. I do not know what happened – they probably died. Ghermay who also lives in Tripoli was already wanted on an arrest warrant in connection with an October 2013 capsizing off Lampedusa that left 366 dead. Reports of the conversations come just days after at least 900 people were feared to have drowned in one of the worst maritime disasters since the end of World War Two. More than 1 700 have perished in the last week alone. Italian police yesterday released Ghermay s photofit as they sought to track down the pair who are among several traffickers wanted in connection with a major human smuggling ring. Ghermay and Medhanie are currently living undisturbed in Tripoli exploiting the lawlessness in the collapse state which has allowed smugglers to operate with impunity since the fall of Gaddafi. Medhanie who reportedly compares himself to the former Libyan dictator and his accomplice enjoy the protection of local law authorities in the capital after it was taken over by a rival Islamist faction.

Others reveal how his business is booming with him heard to say This year I have done well – I sent off 7 000 to 8 000. Another intercept reveals a discussion between Medhanie and his accomplices in Italy about the possibility of setting up bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates but opting for U.S. or Canadian banks because they do not ask you where the money comes from. Safe European governments came under increasing pressure to tackle the Mediterranean s migrant crisis ahead of a summit as harrowing details emerged of the fate of hundreds who died over the weekend . Rescued migrants wait to disembark from the Italian Navy vessel Bettica in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta . Barbaric human traffickers are separating migrants by race locking those with the darkest skin below deck where death is inevitable if the boat sinks survivors have told. Teenagers arriving on the Italian island of Lampedusa told how passengers from sub Saharan Africa were placed in the hold with no water sunlight or crucially means of escape. One boy from Somalia told aid workers from Save The Children The Libyans who got me to Italy are not human. They pushed eight Nigerians into the sea. They all drowned. Conversely Yusuf a 17 year old Palestinian boy who fled Gaza for Italy in February said he was placed on an upper level with other people from the Middle East it was reported by The Independent. Police in Palermo arrested 15 people on Monday in connection with a smuggling ring they say was masterminded by Ghermay. Prosecutors say the network had generated transactions worth hundreds of thousands of euros criss crossing Europe as migrants paid not only to cross the Mediterranean but also to join relatives in northern Europe. Prosecutor Maurizio Scalia said based on telephone intercepts the average cost to smuggle a migrant from Eritrea or Ethiopia to Libya ran USD4 000 to USD5 000 while the crossing to Italy cost an additional USD1 000 to USD1 500. Migrants pay hundreds of dollars more to get out of holding centers and at least another USD1 000 to travel to northern Europe. Payments for each leg are made up front often using the Islamic hawala banking system which is based on an informal honour code in which a relative in northern Europe pays a local broker. The payment information is then transmitted to the actual traffickers on the ground advising them that the leg has been paid for. European governments were today under mounting pressure to act decisively on the Mediterranean migrant crisis as harrowing details emerged of the fate of those who died in the worst tragedy to date. With the crisis set to be discussed at an emergency summit on Thursday allegations of callous disregard for Arab and African lives are pushing EU leaders to respond to a disaster in which 800 people are feared to have died in appalling circumstances off the coast of Libya on Sunday.

The vast majority of those on board were locked in the hold or the middle deck of the 20 metre 66 foot boat when it capsized following a collision with a Portuguese cargo ship responding to its distress signal. Only 28 including two crew members who have been arrested survived and 24 bodies have been recovered. Survivors have described the moment the doomed ship sank telling how how they clung to dead bodies in the pitch black sea in order to stay afloat. They also accused the captain of being drunk moments before he rammed another ship causing the tragedy. Bangladeshi Riajul Islam 17 said the only reason he survived was because he was on the top deck and knew how to swim. Nasir Khan a fellow 17 year old Bangladeshi said he was also on the top deck and lived by clinging on to a life vest. The stricken boat initially set off from Egypt and then stopped off on the Libyan coast near the city Zuwarah to pick up more passengers it has been reported.

Hearing focused on the IRS's habit of targeting conservative groups with special scrutiny based on words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names .
The DOJ says she can't be prosecuted for defying the subpoena 'because she made only general claims of innocence' and offered few details .",After nearly two years of jockeying with Congress over the IRS s history of discriminating against conservative nonprofit groups former official Lois Lerner will not be charged with a crime for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions. U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen on his last day in office told House Speaker John Boehner in a seven page letter that Lerner could wrap herself in the U.S. Constitution s Fifth Amendment even though she offered a self serving opening statement before clamming up during a May 22 2013 hearing. Lerner has long been in the GOP s crosshairs because she led the IRS department tasked with approving nonprofit groups applications for tax exempt status. Beginning in 2010 the department gave conservative groups with words like patriots or tea party in their names extra scrutiny slow walking their applications and keping many in limbo for years. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had subpoenaed Lerner after she refused to testify voluntarily about her role in the scandal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE DOJ S LETTER TO BOEHNER . I will TELL THE TRUTH ... UNLESS I am TAKING THE FIFTH Former IRS official Lois Lerner insisted on her innocence in an opening statement during a 2013 congressional hearing and then refused to answer lawmakers questions – a choice that the Obama administration now says was perfectly legal . U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen left dropped his bomb on Congress just one day before leaving office to return to private legal practice . Emailed Machen s letter was addressed to House Speaker John Boehner left who was in Jerusalem visiting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu right When she refused again to answer questions during a second hearing on March 5 2014 House Republicans prepared a criminal contempt citation and referred the case to the Justice Department once it was approved. California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa then the Oversight committee s chairman told Lerner in one hearing that she had effectively waived your rights by defending herself under oath. I have not done anything wrong Lerner had said in the 2013 hearing. I have not broken any laws I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee. Machen told Boehner on Tuesday that since Lerner had only made general claims of innocence she was within her rights to refuse to answer questions. Ms. Lemer s general denials of wrongdoing did not amount to testimony about the actual facts under the Committee s review he said. The Fiflh Amendment to the Constitution would provide Ms. Lerner with an absolute defense should she be prosecuted for her refusal to testify. Machen s March 31 letter arrived on Capitol Hill just a day before his resignation took effect after a five year stint as Washington D.C. s top federal prosecutor inside the Justice Department. President Barack Obama named him to his post in December 2009. Reactions swept through the nation s capital as word spread that Lerner was legally in the clear. Once again the Obama administration has tried to sweep IRS targeting of taxpayers for their political beliefs under the rug Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told Daily Mail Online. But unaccountable federal bureaucrats using their power to attack the First Amendment strikes at the heart of our democracy and the American people deserve the truth. The White House said Steel still has the opportunity to do the right thing and appoint a special counsel to examine the IRS’ actions. Attorney General Eric Holder has refused repeatedly to bring in a special counsel instead appointing attorney Barbara Bosserman to lead an internal probe. Republicans see Bosserman as a politically conflicted choice Federal Election Commission records show that she donated a total of USD6 750 to Obama’s campaigns and to the Democratic National Committee. SWITCH During the tea party targeting hearings it was Oversight committee ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings left who was regularly exasperated – but now Darrell Issa right his Republican foil at the time is frustrated by a lack of accountability for Lerner . Tea party groups and other conservative organizations seeking tax exempt status were kept in limbo for years while the IRS often green lighted liberal groups in weeks or months . Issa whose outrage led to the congressional contempt citation against Lerner – and one against Holder for refusing to turn over documents related to the scandal – was livid. Refusing to prosecute Mrs. Lerner and Mr. Holder after they were held in contempt by a vote of the House of Representatives sends a disturbing message that it is permissible for senior government officials to lie to Congress and to ignore subpoenas for information vital to Congressional investigations he said Wednesday in a statement. Issa s successor as chairman of the Oversight committee Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz said Machen s letter exhibits a disregard for the rule of law and scoffed at his objectivity. It is unclear whether the Administration directed Mr. Machen not to prosecute Lois Lerner or whether he was motivated by an ideological kinship with IRS’s leadership Chaffetz said. The Committee will continue to pursue its ongoing investigation into the targeting of American citizens based on their political beliefs. Our goal is to ensure that the people responsible including Lois Lerner are held accountable. Lerner s attorney William Taylor said in a statement that his client looks forward to moving on with her life. It is unfortunate that the majority party in the House put politics before a citizen s constitutional rights Taylor said.

Brett McGurk: Iraqi leader making progress with Sunni tribes in planned Anbar offensive .",Washington CNN ISIS is a problem that is off the charts historically and has sent the United States into uncharted territory when it comes to putting down the terror group the Obama administration s point man in the fight recently told CNN. The comments which Brett McGurk made in an exclusive interview were some of the administration s strongest to date in describing the challenge the United States and its allies face in battling ISIS. This is a problem that is off the charts historically he said referring to the more than 20 000 foreign fighters who have gone into Syria. Just put that into perspective It s about twice the number that went into Afghanistan in the 1980s over a 10 year period to fight the Soviet Union and those came really from only a handful of countries. He concluded We are in unchartered territory here. McGurk just returned from an urgent summit of coalition nations held in Jordan. Last week Canada became the latest nation to conduct airstrikes against ISIS over Syria. The United States now lists 62 countries in the coalition. As the U.S. led coalition has focused attention on Iraq and Syria ISIS has expanded its reach to Libya Egypt and Yemen often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants. McGurk did not rule out expanding U.S. military action beyond Iraq and Syria to combat the increasing regional threat. We have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests some of which are military tools he said. Of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do. The United States has also been stepping up efforts to involve Sunni groups in the fight against ISIS. To date that involvement has been extremely limited as Sunni tribes see Shiite militias many with horrendous human rights records take the lead. But McGurk said that Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al Abadi is making progress getting Sunni tribes to support a planned Iraqi offensive against ISIS in Anbar province in the coming weeks. He stressed the importance of working with al Abadi noting that the Iraqi leader was in Anbar province last week handing out more than 1 000 AK 47s to tribal fighters who are going to join the Iraqi security forces. We are helping to enable and train them as they begin to go on the offensive over the coming weeks and months in Anbar McGurk said. They put out this very perverse twisted vision and it s very attractive to a lot of young men around the world he acknowledged. But in fact what the foreign fighters are finding in Syria and Iraq is that they are more likely to get killed in Iraq and Syria and in fact instead of getting a slave bride as ISIS leaders promise them they are more likely to get killed by a female Peshmerga fighter in the streets of Kobani. That bottom line he assessed could turn the tide The foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it s like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate and I think we are going to see those networks begin to dry up.,"washington cnn isis is a problem that is off the charts historically and has sent the united states into uncharted territory when it comes to putting down the terror group the obama administration s point man in the fight recently told cnn.

Held at Broadmoor since being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia .
He is now being considered for a move to the low-security Priory unit .",Notorious mass murderer Peter Sutcliffe who has spent three decades in jail is to be moved to a cushy low security unit it has been claimed . The families of victims of Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe are furious at plans to move him from Broadmoor to a low security Priory unit. Mass murderer Sutcliffe has spent more than three decades in Broadmoor for the savage killings of 13 women. But now despite being one of the country’s most notorious serial killers Sutcliffe may be moved to a cushy Priory unit set in Berkshire woodland. Sutcliffe is being lined up for the move after he expressed remorse and said he no longer hears the voices from God which he had blamed for his killing spree at his 1981 trial. A report is being compiled which will be heard next month at a prison tribunal which will rule if the move goes ahead. But families of his victims are furious about the move. Neil Jackson whose mother Emily 46 became the Ripper s second victim in 1976 told the Sun He should not be moved at all. As he s in Broadmoor he should stay there and they should throw away the key. This just rubs salt into the wounds of families and I believe any remorse he has shown is fake. A source at the prison told the newspaper Sutcliffe was optimistic about the move despite being previously turned down for a transfer to the unit which boasts facilities such as a fully fitted gym and music room. Plans of his referral follow allegations earlier this year that Sutcliffe who used weapons including a hammer screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England was enjoying an easy lifestyle in jail. Scroll down for video . Potential plans to move Britain s most notorious mass murderer from the high security Broadmoor prison hospital to the Priory . Hospital Broadmoor s corridors look ordinary but it houses some of Britain s most disturbed individuals . He was said to be eating chocolate watching television and listening to music as well as being privileged to receive visitors four days a week who can stay for up to four hours. It was claimed he is also given money to spend in the psychiatric hospital’s shop and attends a ceramics workshop and twice weekly Bible studies sessions. It has been claimed that Sutcliffe is now a Jehovah’s Witness and was even given a baptism. In the evenings he watches TV shows such as The X Factor and I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! the Sun on Sunday reported. A new image of a relaxed looking Sutcliffe – the first for 20 years – supports the cushy lifestyle claim. There has been little change to his distinctive appearance apart from an increase in weight and the greying of his hair and beard. He had ballooned with some reports estimating his weight at 19 or 20 stone which is said to be down to a love of chocolate and burgers and now sufferers from type 2 diabetes. Sutcliffe is currently said to enjoy a cushy lifestyle in Broadmoor eating chocolate watching television and listening to music it was claimed . The Priory Thornford Park set in Berkshire woodland . While officials refused to comment on the move it is thought that Sutcliffe would be transferred to a unit such as the Priory Thornford Park. Based just 30 miles from Broadmoor it is set in Berkshire woodland and offers a fully equipped gym and running track a music room and occupational therapy suite. A rehab kitchen and computer and education rooms are also amongst the high end facilities at the unit. The red brick building houses 122 men with mental illness compared to Broadmoor s 210 with a combination of low and medium secure beds. Past residents include dangerous criminal John Maguir convicted for assault who escaped by scaling a wall and child sex abuser Peter Pickering. Its website states its users are among the most vulnerable members of society and require sensitive therapeutic interventions delivered in a healing environment that encourages self awareness knowledge and empowerment. The full list of facilities include . The former trucker who notoriously targeted prostitutes during his five year killing spree has seen his health deteriorate in recent years. He had a hernia operation in 2013 and was reported to have suffered a heart attack. The murderer who is already blind in one eye after a prison attack was also told he could lose what remains of his sight within a year due to an eye condition. He had refused laser eye surgery as he fears it could cause him to lose his vision immediately. The claims about his lifestyle have angered victims’ families. Roofer Neil Jackson 56 whose mother Emily was Sutcliffe’s second victim said ‘He tore apart our family and this just looks like he’s being rewarded. He’s getting an easy life and he’s clearly enjoying every minute. I hope the lifestyle kills him. ‘It doesn’t matter how many years go by it doesn’t make the pain of what he did any easier.’ Peter Sutcliffe the Yorkshire Ripper after an attack by another prisoner in 1982 with a broken coffee jar . Sutcliffe has been in Broadmoor since he was given 20 life sentences in 1981. As well as the 13 women he killed he tried to murder seven more in a five year spree. The killer who believed he was on a mission from God to kill sex workers was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1984. He refused treatment until 1993 when the Mental Health Commission ruled that he should be given anti psychotic medication forcibly. He has been attacked at least three times behind bars. The second assault put his right eye out and another inmate then unsuccessfully attempted to do the same for his left . It costs taxpayers more than GBP300 000 a year to detain him in Broadmoor at least five times the cost of a prison cell. Last year his plea to be moved to a unit in his home county of West Yorkshire was rejected. In 2010 an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected with a High Court judge saying he should never be released. The Priory and the Prison Service declined to comment on the move while a spokeswoman for the Department of Health which is responsible for the medical unit said they would not comment on individual cases.,"notorious mass murderer peter sutcliffe who has spent three decades in jail is to be moved to a cushy low security unit it has been claimed.

Rule was one of the entry requirements for a new nursing school in Raqqa .
NHS has also attempted to introduce English language checks for nurses .
But despite the law being approved, a lengthy consultation process means EU-trained nurses are still being employed without English tests .",English essential This laminated document announces the new ISIS nursing school and lists the language entry requirements for would be nurses . Militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in Syria have announced that all nurses working in areas under their control must speak English something the NHS still has not introduced. Revealing plans to open a school of nursing in ISIS de facto capital Raqqa the extremists also disclosed the tough entry requirements for prospective medical workers. Among them are rules that applicants are no more than 25 years of age must be willing to work anywhere inside the territory controlled by the extremists and must speak fluent English. The latter rule is something that even the NHS has yet fully put in place with nurses who trained in European countries still able to treat patients without any formal language checks thanks to bureaucratic rules barring the Nursing and Midwifery Council testing EU candidates. Details of the first nursing school to be opened in ISIS held territory were revealed by on Twitter by Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently an activist group based in the Syrian city that uses a network of brave informers to document the daily atrocities carried out by the Islamic extremists. RIBSS shared a photograph of a laminated document written in Arabic giving details of the new medical school and listing the entry requirements for would be nurses. It states that all candidates be aged between 18 and 25 pass an entry exam impress during an interview graduated from secondary school with science qualifications be willing to travel to any ISIS held area and willing work for ISIS institutions for at least two years after graduating. The document also states the importance of English saying candidates will not be accepted without knowing how to speak and understand the language. This is in stark contrast with Britain where English language checks for all nurses are still not being enforced despite legislation being passed last month making them a legal requirement. Jihadis ISIS has English language rules for all nurses. The NHS does not have the same level of checks . Although the law has changed the Nursing and Midwifery Council must engage in a lengthy consultation process draft new legislation and seek council approval before it can test the English language skills of nurses who trained within the EU. Students graduating from ISIS nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating. However the announcement in Raqqa promised that graduate nurses who achieved top grades and showed the most promise at the school will be considered for places as ISIS medical school where they can train for better paid jobs such as doctors and surgeons. ISIS English language rules have been put in place long before the NHS has been able to bring in similar checks. Militants Students graduating from ISIS nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating . ISIS has launched English language radio news bulletins on its Iraqi broadcast service complete with information on the latest suicide bombings and martyrdom operations . The extremist group s first English bulletin aired on Tuesday on its al Bayan radio network which already boasts updates in both Arabic and Russian. The nine and a half minute broadcast which begins and ends with traditional sounding Arabic music is hosted by a man with an American accent who takes the listener through the main events of the day. It also boasts of ISIS fighters roasting the flesh of their opponents car bombs killing people and destroying an idol and so called martyrdom operations . It ends thanking the listener for tuning in . Last year the law was changed to make it legal for all foreign nurses midwives and dentists from outside the European Union to be forced to take an IELTS language exam if it was felt their English made them unsafe in a medical environment. Since then 429 doctors from outside the EU have been refused a licence to practise medicine in the UK because their English language skills are not up to scratch. Similar rules were passed last month extending those rules to prospective medical who trained inside the EU a rule quickly adopted by doctors and dentists. The rule is still not being by the Nursing and Midwifery Council however as the regulator requires a lengthy public consultation process before it can amend its rules. Even then the law will only apply to candidates who medical authorities judge could be a danger due to poor English language skills. In such an instance the nurse would first be required to prove sufficient English language experience such as from a GCSE style qualification or they will be forced to take the British Council s IELTS qualification to access whether they have reached a suitable level for their job.,"english essential this laminated document announces the new isis nursing school and lists the language entry requirements for would be nurses.

30,30,7f53ab255bad30f06dccb9041db53f4b8f5ad29c,"Kevin Streelman beat Camilo Villegas on third play-off hole at Augusta .
Tiger Woods played in the par-three contest for the first time since 2004 .
Jack Nicklaus recorded his first ever hole-in-one at the Masters .",Jack Nicklaus recorded his first ever hole in one at the Masters on Wednesday as Camilo Villegas fired two in the space of five holes but still could not win the traditional par three contest. Villegas holed out on the fourth and eighth as he finished alongside Kevin Streelman on five under par only to find water on the eighth when he played it again as the third play off hole. Kevin Streelman holds his trophy aloft after winning the Par 3 Contest on a play off against Camilo Villegas . Streelman therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the curse of the par three champion with no player ever becoming par three and Masters champion in the same year. However that was placed firmly into perspective thanks to his 11 year old caddie Ethan Couch who has a benign but inoperable brain tumour. Streelman found Couch via the Make a Wish Foundation and invited him to be his caddie in the light hearted curtain raiser. Augusta National s par three course traditionally hosts the contest the day before start of the major . It was a really fun day especially to have Ethan with me here Streelman said. This is not about me today. It s about helping him out and showing him a great day. Villegas said I have made a few hole in ones but it s pretty special to make them here. The second one we were a little more emotional there. We just kind of jumped. Nicklaus had earlier holed out with an eight iron from 123 yards on the fourth his ball landing around 15 feet past the pin and spinning back into the hole. Woods played in the Masters par three contest at Augusta National for the first time in 11 years . That took the 75 year old six time champion to three under par but he would bogey the fifth and hit two balls into the water on the ninth to end his hopes of an unlikely triumph. Former US Open champion Curtis Strange reminded Nicklaus of the tradition that players who make a hole in one have to buy the drinks in the clubhouse when Nicklaus walked past the ESPN commentary position. Send me a bill Nicklaus replied. The Masters official Twitter account shared an image of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods with Niall Horan . The 18 time major winner added on ESPN I never had a hole in one at Augusta in the par three contest or on the golf course. Doing an interview this morning I said all I have to do is go out there make a hole in one and win the par three. I had it three under and then choked. Since the contest started in 1960 nobody has ever become par three and Masters champion in the same week a fact which sometimes sees players deliberately not shoot the best score possible. Most treat it as light relief and invite family or friends to act as their caddies including Tiger Woods this year for the first time since 2004. Woods had his children Charlie and Sam on his bag and made sure he could not win the event by getting daughter Sam to tap in for par on the sixth. Jack Nicklaus centre with Ben Crenshaw left and Gary Player right during the Par 3 Contest . We had an absolutely great time. These were memories for a lifetime said Woods who was also accompanied by girlfriend Lindsey Vonn. He later added on Twitter I will always have memories of my pop at Augusta and now Sam & Charlie. An amazing day. Tournament favourite Rory McIlroy had One Direction singer Niall Horan acting as his caddie and Horan proved he should stick to singing after badly hooking a tee shot on the ninth into the water. I apologise to golf Horan joked. I do perform to a lot of people but we were performing to their parents today! There was a lot of pressure. McIlroy who is looking to become the sixth player to complete the career grand slam by winning a first Masters title on Sunday added I wanted to do this because it s a big week for me and just to go into the tournament in a relaxed mood. To spend a couple of hours like this was fun.,"jack nicklaus recorded his first ever hole in one at the masters on wednesday as camilo villegas fired two in the space of five holes but still could not win the traditional par three contest.

Violence erupted after more than 100 demonstrators took part in a rally to mark Palestinian Prisoners Day .
Israel has arrested around 800,000 Palestinians in the occupied territories since 1967 with 6,000 currently being held .",Barely out of nappies this five year old boy was not the most likely candidate to take on six heavily armed troops. But that did not stop the Palestinian youngster dressed in full combat gear from attempting to pelt Israeli police with stones during violent clashes on the West Bank. The bemused officers equipped with helmets and body armour calmly watched as the child launched his own assault before racing away. The incident raised fears that Palestinian children are being encouraged to mimic and glorify violence. David and Goliath battle A five year old Palestinian boy pelted the Israeli police with stones as violence erupted during a rally in the northern West Bank . The dark haired child dressed in combat gear raced back to safety after launching a series of missiles at around six heavily armed officers . The boy s stone attack came as violence erupted on the northern West Bank during annual demonstrations to mark Palestinian Prisoners Day. Soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd after more than 100 Palestinians rallied near Israel s separation barrier in the village of Bilin with some throwing stones. At least one protester was believed to have been injured as violence flared on the streets. Prisoners Day is marked every year in solidarity with the more than 6 000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. We will not leave our prisoners in jail alone rally organiser Abdullah Abu Rahma said. We will defend their right to be released because the majority of them have been arrested illegally by Israeli forces. With Israel having arrested some 800 000 Palestinians in the occupied territories since 1967 equivalent to 40 percent of the male population almost every Palestinian family has been affected. During the last round of US backed peace talks in 2013 and 2014 Israel freed dozens of long term inmates. But after the negotiations broke down and following the kidnap and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank Israel arrested hundreds more. The current number of Palestinian prisoners is the highest for at least five years according to figures from rights groups. More than 100 protesters used catapults to fire rocks at the Israeli forces after violence erupted during a rally to mark Palestinian Prisoners Day . The Israeli forces used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd that had gathered near the West Bank city of Nablus . This protester s face was left covered in blood after he was injured during the violent clashes on the street . Heavily armed members of the Israeli police force took on the protesters after they started throwing bricks and stones .,"barely out of nappies this five year old boy was not the most likely candidate to take on six heavily armed troops.

Wigan s Jason Pearce right is congratulated by Pennant left as he scores the second equaliser for his side . A stylish Jermaine Pennant free kick hauled Wigan level only for a stunning long range effort from Matt Smith put Fulham back in front. But Jason Pearce s 69th minute effort when he tucked in a corner at the far post earned the Latics a point. I have just said to the players that I feel very proud of them considering we only had two days to work said former Latics skipper Caldwell. It s crazy absolutely crazy. An all consuming job. But I loved every minute of it and can not wait for the next one. I have had a lot of managers texting me saying welcome to the madhouse and I can see what they mean. A point lifted Wigan above Millwall who they face on Tuesday on goal difference but both teams are seven points adrift of safety. Matt Smith scores Fulham s second goal to restore their lead against Wigan at Carven Cottage on Friday . Smith slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the Championship match . Caldwell has not been put in charge to perform a miracle but he still insists there is plenty to play for. We will try to win every game he added. There s 12 points to play for and we will try to win every one and see what happens. It s going to be a long process to get the club to where we want it to be. But tonight was the way we want to play that s how this club got success. Fulham should now be safe having edged nine points clear of the drop zone but they were booed off by sections of the home support. Boss Kit Symons honeymoon period seems to be over as his decision to take off goalscorer Smith after an hour was met with a chorus of you do not know what you are doing . Fulham captain Scott Parker right is hassled for the ball by Wigan s Gaetan Bong left at Craven Cottage . The ever industrious Parker left dribbles away from the challenge of Wigan s Kim Bo Kyung right Matt was shattered he explained. He s had a lot of football recently and we needed some fresh legs. Symons has the air of a manager who cannot wait for the season to come to an end. It s glass half full glass half empty he added. We are a point closer to safety and come the end of the season it might be the point that keeps us in the division. It s been a tough season to put it mildly and realistically it was probably always going to be like that.

Although it seems the BBC make up department may have gone for a little gentle pruning rather than offering up the full shaven reveal in a bid to stay true to the 18th century male grooming that Ross Poldark himself might have partaken in. It s unlikely that such a character would have reached for the razor so a smattering of hair remains. Aidan s chest has been the subject of much viewer devotion throughout the series so far thanks to the actor disrobing in plenty of scenes. Fans have taken to Twitter to comment on the latest Poldark male grooming debate. One viewer remarked that she would rather see her favourite star with a full rug Asked to shave his chest hair off !! I d rather he had it all! Scythed but not clean shaven The brooding star has stubble but not the bearded look the actor appears to favour in real life . Still brooding but a more natural image A bearded Aidan pictured with his girlfriend Sarah Greene at the premiere for The Hobbit back in 2014 . While others have commented that even a smattering is too much. User Laura Kate said I just can not forgive that chest hair. I just can not! But it s Aiden turner I could try. . And some got hot under the collar at the very thought of it. Tattooed_Mummy wrote on the social media site I can not think of anything other than running my hands through Ross Poldark s chest hair. The actor has confessed that he is inherently lazy when it comes to perfecting his body beautiful and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached. I worked hard for six weeks killing myself in the gym watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never ever do all that if I wasn t prepping for a role. That s the only time it just happens he explained. I am not like that now. I am back to my usual soft self.,"first it was revealed that lashings of baby oil were used to keep aidan turner s rippling torso looking suitably divine in the hit bbc sunday night series poldark.

It is the first time that Labour leader has been ahead in approval ratings .
Labour Party has also taken a commanding four point lead over the Tories .",Ed Miliband has overtaken David Cameron as the most popular political leader for the first time. In a shock new poll that will send shockwaves through Downing Street the Labour leader has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings. The Labour Party has also taken a commanding four point lead over the Tories with just 28 days until polling day according to the pollsters Survation. Labour leader Ed Miliband has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings a Survation poll has revealed . The revelation comes in the wake of a furious political row over the Labour leader’s personal character – after the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mr Miliband could stab Britain in the back like he did to his brother. Mr Miliband responded by accusing the Tories of dragging the election campaign ‘into the gutter’. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader. But the campaign could backfire if Mr Miliband overtakes the Prime Minister in the polls. According to tonight’s Survation poll for the Daily Mirror with less than a month until the general election Labour has opened up a four point gap over the Tories. Labour is up 2 points on 35 the Conservatives down one to 31. Nigel Farage’s Ukip meanwhile are down three to 15 with the Lib Dems still struggling on just 9 per cent. The SNP and the Greens are on 4 per cent each. It is the biggest Labour lead in a Survation poll since February and was conducted after the party announced plans to scrap a ‘tax loophole’ used by wealthy ‘non doms’ to lower their tax bills. With less than a month until the general election Labour has opened up a four point gap over the Tories. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader . According to tonight’s poll nearly seven out of ten voters back Mr Miliband’s proposal to scrap the non dom tax status. Four out of 10 voters ‘strongly’ support the move – with just 14 per cent opposed. The poll surveyed 1 111 people on Wednesday and Thursday. Miliband announced on Wednesday that he wanted to scrap tax rules that allow wealthy individuals to legally reduce the amount of tax they pay on money earned overseas. The Survation poll found 59 percent of respondents supported the idea. A separate poll by Yougov for The Sun newspaper on Wednesday gave Labour a one percentage point lead over the Conservatives.,"ed miliband has overtaken david cameron as the most popular political leader for the first time.

More than 2 000 office workers had to be evacuated yesterday due to the fire in Holborn which apparently started in a tunnel carrying electrical cables causing flames to erupt from the pavement and filling the area with smoke. Although the blaze has now been brought under control it has not been put out entirely and firefighters still do not know the cause of the fire. Scroll down for video . Blaze The scene in Holborn today where a fire has been raging for more than 24 hours . Emergency Firefighters and gas workers were still battling to put out the fire a day later . Plume Flames rose up from the street in the deserted part of central London today . Continuing Firefighters spraying water into a manhole in a bid to put out a fire in Holborn . Much of the area is cordoned off as firefighters struggle to extinguish the fire while there were reports of major delays in central London. Commuters were urged to avoid travelling through Holborn if possible and firefighters were unable to estimate when the situation might return to normal. Tonight 35 firefighters and police officers remain at Kingsway where flames were seen erupting from a manhole cover yesterday. Kingsway is closed as is the Strand underpass while Waterloo Bridge is closed northbound. Transport for London said that 15 bus routes were being diverted and witnesses described seeing dozens of buses backed up along High Holborn but Underground services have returned to normal. More than 1 000 buildings remain without power today with businesses government departments and tourist attractions forced to close ahead of the Easter weekend. firefighters and gas workers continue to tackle the flames in the Kingsway Service Tunnel . Carnage Parts of the road had to be dug up in an attempt to extinguish the fire below the ground . The underground fire has stopped power workers from accessing their equipment . Jets Firefighters deployed multiple hoses to combat the blaze which wreaked havoc on the area . Exhausted Firefighters looked tired as they took a break after working at the scene for hours . Blocked Roads were closed in the wake of the fire whose cause is still unknown . UK Power Networks said that 100 staff had worked through the night to restore electricity to the area but it is not known when buildings will regain power. A spokesman said A major gas fire in an underground tunnel is still burning so we cannot yet access our equipment. Our engineers have restored power to 2 000 customers and the remaining 1 100 will regain power through generators and cable works as soon as possible. We had over a hundred staff working through the night and work continues today. We are working with the emergency services and other agencies to keep affected customers updated. The cause of the incident is being investigated. Fire crews last night doused the hole with water before they smashed the cover open with a sledgehammer and continued to pump in water from multiple hoses. Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said that the fact the fire started in an underground tunnel meant it had been tricky to bring it under control. This has been a technically difficult incident to tackle he said. The reason that the fire is still burning is because the service tunnel is hard to reach and although firefighters have been applying water through access points throughout the night the complexity of the tunnel layout means that it will be some time until the fire is fully extinguished. However the fire is contained and we are making steady progress and working with the utility companies and the police to bring this incident to a close. Works More than 100 power workers were deployed to restore electricity to businesses in central London . Disruption The road closures were said to have caused severe traffic jams in the surrounding area . Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said the blaze was a technically difficult incident to tackle Deserted The Holborn area was emptied of workers and shoppers thanks to the disruption . Closure Shops had signs in their windows apologising for the inconvenience . One council boss warned that there was a worrying trend of pavements exploding in central London and said that businesses had been hit by the accidents. We do not fully yet know what caused the fire in Holborn on Wednesday said Richard Beddoe of Westminster Council. However pavements have exploded in central London previously and it is a very worrying trend. Our message remains the same we want to see better investment in the capital s infrastructure as it benefits the whole UK. We are relieved to hear that there were no serious casualties but the losses to big businesses in the West End due to poor infrastructure is just not acceptable. We want to see action. In July Piccadilly Circus was closed after an electrical fault beneath a manhole cover caused an explosion which resulted in a lorry catching fire. Meanwhile in February last year 50 people were evacuated from a street in north London after a pavement burst into flames. And in April 2013 a fireball burst from a pavement in Pimlico Road central London narrowly missing a passer by standing yards away. A UK Power Networks spokesman said There have been a small number of incidents disturbing pavements over recent years caused by a variety of reasons and affecting utility infrastructures underground. Blackout Power was knocked out across the area and more than 1 000 buildings remain without electricity . Dramatic This aerial image shows how a wide area of London was left without power . Scene These file photos show tunnels under Holborn near to where the fire broke out . Smoke More than 2 000 workers were forced to flee their central London workplaces . Among the buildings affected by the fire is the Royal Courts of Justice home to the High Court and Court of Appeal which was due to remain closed all day. Somerset House the London School of Economics and the London Transport Museum were closed while the English National Ballet cancelled its planned matinee performances of Swan Lake. One of the offices affected by the fire was that of HM Inspectorate of Prisons which is closed as a result of the power cut. Gillian Perham 54 lives near the fire and said there had been similar incidents in recent years. There was an exploding pavement not far from here last year she said. We are fed up with it. I am terrified it s going to happen when I am near one. At one point yesterday 70 firefighters and 10 engines were at the scene of the blaze which forced a number of West End theatres to cancel shows last night including The Lion King Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Play That Goes Wrong.

Paladini has been searching for a way back into football since he left Loftus Road in 2011 and has attempted to buy Birmingham City from Carson Yeung. The Italian seems to have enjoyed more success in West Yorkshire where he has forged an official link to Bradford a club which has been one of the great success stories of the season. Former QPR chief Gianni Paladini appears to be keen on taking over the reins at League One side Bradford . Bradford s most memorable moment of the season came during their shock FA Cup win over Chelsea . Phil Parkinson’s team captured the imagination of fans across the nation when they fought back from 2 0 down to win 4 2 at Chelsea in the FA Cup and went on to beat Sunderland before losing in a quarter final replay at Reading. Those FA Cup exploits came against a backdrop of colourful and passionate support. They took 8 000 supporters to Stamford Bridge and generated a brilliant atmosphere for the tie at home to Sunderland. It was a reminder of the club’s enormous potential having been led out of the doldrums of League Two and administration by chairmen Julian Rhodes and Mark Lawn with the help of Parkinson’s managerial skill. Lawn has spoken of the need to attract new investment and Paladini is registered as the sole director of Bradford City Holdings Limited set up in February. The company was originally set up with Paladini and Mauro Milanese named as directors but Milanese’s name has been removed. Paladini has previously made an attempt to buy Birmingham from Carson Yeung pictured Milanese is a former centre half who played for several Italian clubs and had one year at QPR during a long playing career and briefly managed Leyton Orient last year. Paladini’s ambitions to return to football are well documented. As well as trying to buy Birmingham he has been linked possible takeovers at Millwall and Reading. Bradford were beaten 6 0 at home by Bristol City on Tuesday which confirmed Bristol City’s promotion to the Championship and virtually ended Bradford’s hopes of capping an incredible season by reaching the play offs. Paladini spent eight years at QPR seizing control after a complicated takeover in 2003 and attracting investment from billionaires Lakshmi Mittal and F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore. He left his role at Loftus Road in 2011 following the takeover by Tony Fernandes.,"former queens park rangers chairman gianni paladini has registered as a director of a new bradford city holding company in what appears to be the first move towards taking control at valley parade.

After a quiet start Boro soon started to find their feet and when Rotherham failed to clear a corner in the 10th minute returning defender Daniel Ayala tried an ambitious bicycle kick which went straight into Emiliano Martinez s hands. The home side dominated the first half and on the half hour they had two bites at the cherry. First Ayala s header was cleared off the line before Tomlin s follow up shot was blocked. It was Albert Adomah s turn to have a pop three minutes later when he shot from just inside the area but Martinez did well to get down to it and he was also denied by Danny Lafferty on the line minutes later. The opening goal came five minutes into the second half when Tomlin pressed forward and the Millers defenders stood off the forward allowing him time and space to plant a low shot past Martinez. The United keeper had to be on his toes again five minutes after the goal when Kike played a smart ball in behind the defence for Bamford but Martinez did well to smother the ball at his feet. Kike had a shot saved on the hour before Bamford doubled Boro s lead six minutes later with his 16th goal of the season. Tomlin laid the ball off for the Chelsea forward and he took one touch before coolly rolling the ball past Martinez into the bottom corner. Rotherham had a rare shot at goal after 73 minutes when substitute Lee Frecklington hit a powerful drive which had Dimi Konstantopoulos beaten but it flew past his post. Patrick Bamford left doubled the Teesiders lead on 66 minutes with a cool left footed finish . The 21 year old celebrates his strike taking his personal tally to 16 league goals this season so far . But it was Boro who looked like the only side capable of scoring and the third nearly came in the 77th minute when Tomlin clipped an exquisite ball to the back post but Bamford s first time half volley was easily saved by Martinez at his near post. Sub Emilio Nsue should have made it three with two minutes to go when he had an open goal but his shot was deflected just wide. And from the resulting corner Kike met Adam Forshaw s ball with a thumping header which Martinez had to tip over the bar.

May said trio planned to continue making show before leaving 'with dignity'",Jeremy Clarkson and his fellow Top Gear presenters were just about to renew their lucrative contacts for three more years but they were scrapped when the star punched the show s producer. James May 52 revealed he had prematurely celebrated the three year deal by ordering a rare GBP200 000 Ferrari before Clarkson s sacking after an infamous fracas with producer Oisin Tymon. May says he had ordered the last ever Ferrari 458 Speciale in bright orange while the draft version of the lucrative contract was sitting on his desk with only a few details to resolve . But after Clarkson punched Tymon in a rage over a hot meal the offer was taken off the table. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson right and his Top Gear colleagues had been on the brink of a lucrative new contract when Clarkson s infamous fracas led to the offer being taken away . May revealed that he had prematurely celebrated the three year deal while the contract was still being finalised by ordering a GBP200 000 Ferrari 458 Speciale in bright orange pictured The presenter said the trio had planned to continue making the show until the end of the new contract before leaving with dignity . But Clarkson 55 was sensationally sacked by the BBC last month and Richard Hammond 45 joined May in confirming he will not return to Top Gear this week. Writing in a column for the Sunday Times May said There we were all three of us on the brink of a new three year contract to make Top Gear after which we would definitely chuck it in with dignity and hand the reins to a new generation assuming we were still alive . There were a few details to resolve about time frames and other mundane stuff but the groaning draft version of this document was actually sitting on my desk. This was a great privilege and a once in a lifetime event an invitation to continue presenting the world s biggest TV show for – let us not be shy – a handsome salary. The three men had planned to stay on for another three years before quitting with dignity until Clarkson was sensationally sacked after punching show producer Oisin Tymon pictured On the future he remained vague suggested the three may be reunited on screen or go in separate directions. Now May admits ordering a brand new Ferrari is a strange thing for an unemployed person to do but insists he has no regrets describing the purchase as a once in lifetime opportunity. He acknowledged the supercar was an extravagant purchase at GBP208 090 but that it was better than money in the bank . Meanwhile Clarkson was seen talking himself out of a parking ticket for his bright green Lamborghini yesterday after leaving it parked on yellow lines in London. Elsewhere Hammond told reporters at a charity bike rally that the future will be exciting for the three men but refused to speculate further on the future of Top Gear. He said Everybody knows what s happened. That s all been in the news. The future nobody knows yet do they And I cannot and will not speculate further than that. So do not know let us see. It ll be exciting whatever. There is mounting speculation the men are working on a new motoring series to be aired by Netflix Amazon or another British broadcaster. Producer Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries. Police investigated the attack but Tymon told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would not be pursuing the matter any further. James May right was vague on the future for the trio hinting that they may be reunited on screen .,"jeremy clarkson and his fellow top gear presenters were just about to renew their lucrative contacts for three more years but they were scrapped when the star punched the show s producer.

Kevin Brown and Patrick Ah Van replied for Widnes .",Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye catching hat trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22 8 to make it back to back wins for the first time since last June. Lineham scored a treble in a losing cause at Castleford last month but his efforts on Friday night settled a drab contest at the KC Stadium. The 22 year old winger showed good opportunism and no little speed on two occasions to pluck passes out of the air and race over 90 metres to add to his early opener. The hat trick puts him out in front as Super League s most prolific finisher in 2015. Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye catching hat trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22 8 . Jamie Shaul went over late on to make sure of the two competition points for Hull with tries from Kevin Brown and Patrick Ah Van unable to prevent Widnes from falling to a fifth away defeat out of five. It was a third match in nine days for both sides although Widnes had reason to feel more hard done by after their Easter Monday trip to Catalans. Ah Van had an early opportunity to give the Vikings an extra spring in their step but a foot in touch saw his effort ruled out although Rhys Hanbury s pass was forward in any case. There was no doubt when Lineham slid over in the corner at the other end after Shaul had spun out of a tackle and found his winger with a nice cut out pass. The Vikings were defending doggedly near their own line to prevent a second Hull try when Stefan Marsh and Chris Dean were both forced off following a sickening clash of heads. Lineham had a good chance to lay the platform for another Hull raid following a break down the right but his pass was intercepted by former Black and Whites hooker Aaron Heremaia. Widnes worked their way downfield and were back level when Brown whose high kick in the build up appeared to have gone forward off Ah Van forced the ball down from dummy half. The Vikings lost a third player as Lloyd White hobbled off but they thought they had edged in front when Joe Mellor touched down his own dab through only for the video referee to correctly rule a knock on. What might have been a half time lead turned into a six point deficit as Lineham intercepted Brown s pass and raced 95 metres for a try which took him level with Castleford s Justin Carney on nine for the season. And he was out on his own as leading try scorer when he repeated the trick just after the break Hanbury the victim on this occasion as he tried to find Ah Van 10 metres from the Hull line. Lineham almost turned provider on the hour mark but his wild pass could not be taken in by Shaul. Jordan Rankin was then wide with a 40 metre penalty attempt after play had been brought back for a shoulder charge by Eamon O Carroll. But Hull did not have to wait too much longer for their next points as Rankin s grubber kick hit a post and sat up perfectly for Shaul to slide over. Widnes who saw Gil Dudson held up over the line earlier in the half gave themselves some hope when Ah Van finished spectacularly in the corner but it proved no more than a consolation.,"tom lineham scored two interception tries in an eye catching hat trick as hull fc beat widnes 22 8 to make it back to back wins for the first time since last june.

The same skeptics also warn of the health risks associated with consuming less than 3,000 milligrams .
Average American ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day .",For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt but now new research is questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt . For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt but new research is now questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt. Both federal government regulations and the American Heart Association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year. As the federal government prepares its influential Dietary Guidelines for 2015 some scientists are now saying that the average American salt consumption rate carries no risk. The guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2 300 milligrams with an even stricter 1 500 milligram limit for African Americans and people over 50. In February the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended keeping the larger limit although it withdrew support for the stricter limit for African Americans and people over 50 reports The Washington Post. There is no longer any valid basis for the current salt guidelines said Andrew Mente a professor at McMaster University in Ontario and one of the researchers involved in a major study published last year by the New England Journal of Medicine. So why are we still scaring people about salt While experts on both sides agree that eating too much salt especially for people with high blood pressure can be dangerous there is much disagreement over what constitutes too much. The average American ingests about 3 500 milligrams of salt per day the amount of sodium in a teaspoon of salt and so under the current dietary guidelines Americans are indeed endangering themselves. Even within the American Heart Association one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits there is disagreement with at least one former president claiming that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure . Salt skeptics however believe most Americans are fine. In their view a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6 000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks. The skeptics also warn of the dangers of consuming too little they say that below 3 000 milligrams also raises health risks. The PURE study published last August by the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who conform to the recommended limits 2 300 milligrams actually have more heart trouble. They found that low sodium may stimulate the production of renin a hormone that may have harmful effects on blood vessels. Even within the American Heart Association one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits there is disagreement. The totality of the evidence strongly suggests that Americans should be lowering their sodium intake said Elliott Antman the president of the American Heart Association. Everyone agrees that current sodium intake is too high.

Two Florida corrections officers and one former officer trainee have been charged in a plot to kill a former inmate who was getting out of prison the Florida Attorney General s office said Thursday. An FBI informant met the men Thomas Jordan Driver 25 David Elliot Moran 47 and Charles Thomas Newcomb 42 after infiltrating a branch of the KKK the Traditional American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan CNN affiliate WJXT reported. Driver told the informant that he had gotten into a fight with the inmate and that he and Moran wanted him six feet under according to court documents. To convince the suspects that the deed had been done the FBI staged a fake homicide scene with the former inmate and took pictures to show them that he had been killed. When the FBI staged this crime scene and these photographs were shown to each of these men they were happy about it said Statewide Prosecutor Nick Cox.

Admitted Charles had sent him a lot of letters while he was in government .
Released two, including one condolence letter over death of his mother .
Comes after court ruled Charles's letters to ministers should be published .",Labour peer John Prescott has defended Prince Charles over allegations he tries to secretly influence government policy with scrawled private notes to ministers insisting he should right to write as many damn letters as he likes . The former deputy prime minister said he cannot see a problem with the future King writing to government ministers and insisted he had a lot to offer this country . Lord Prescott s intervention comes after the Supreme Court backed a previous ruling paving the way for the publication of Prince Charles s so called black spider memos. Lord Prescott left said that the Prince of Wales has a lot to offer the country . The letters were penned between September 2004 and March 2005 and sent by the Prince to seven government departments. Lord Prescott whose letters are separate to those due to be released said that while he is not a raving loyalist he has a lot of time for Charles who he described as a passionate environmentalist. He said while he listens to the views of everyone who contacts him on political matters he makes his own decisions. The former Labour minister writing in the Sunday Mirror said Charles has an awful lot to offer this country. And if he wants to serve his subjects by helping young people into work combating climate change and building sustainable communities he can write as many damn letters as he likes. Lord Prescott published extracts from two letters he received from the Prince including one expressing his sadness at the death of the Labour politician s mother. The Labour peer said the notes proved the measure of the man . He said They show he has nothing to hide and he should not be worried about publication. The first letter is a typed ­invitation to a meeting of Regional­ ­Development Agency leaders in 1999. Charles says it would be splendid to see Lord Prescott. The second is more personal and was written in the Prince s ­distinctive handwriting in 2003. It expresses sadness at the death of Lord Prescott s mother. The Prince opens by joking that he has been overdoing the quota of letters to the Deputy PM. Prince Charles with the Duchess of Cornwall at Ascot races last week does a lot of good for the country according to the former Labour minister Lord Prescott . But despite this – and the trouble the press would give him – he goes on to express his sadness and says his heart goes out to the politician. He added I did receive letters from the prince when I was in government but they had no effect on any policy. People say he should not be writing to ministers but he s quite entitled to express his opinion. Politicians are lobbied all the time by individuals and groups and none of them would allow a letter – even from Prince Charles – to unduly ­influence them. Prince Charles has long been accused of bombarding ministers with black spider memos attacking government policy. His letters are so named after his distinctive handwriting and abundant use of underlining and exclamation marks. Both Clarence House and the Prime Minister expressed disappointment after the court ruling. The notes reflect according to previous attorney general Dominic Grieve the prince s most deeply held personal views and beliefs .,"labour peer john prescott has defended prince charles over allegations he tries to secretly influence government policy with scrawled private notes to ministers insisting he should right to write as many damn letters as he likes.

Simply open Tinder go to your new profile and connect it to your Instagram account with a single tap your Tinder profile will automatically start displaying your recent Instagram photos. Tinder only displays the last 34 photos users can venture out to the app for a look at the full library. You asked we listened the firm said. We’ve made some exciting new changes to your Tinder profile including a slick new Instagram integration and more common friends. The firm said it made the changes after noticing many users put their Instagram user name in their profile. Now there’s no need to put your Instagram handle in your profile description to tell your story we got sick of having to do that too . It also stressed that the app would not let other visitors to your Instagram feed know it was part of a dating profile. And in case you were wondering Tinder won’t post anything to Instagram on your behalf or alter your existing Instagram privacy settings. Tinder has overhauled its profile as part of the Instagram integration and now shows friends of friends as well as more interests . The firm has also used Facebook to boost its mutual friends feature. Tinder now shows you the mutual friends and friends of friends you have in common with your potential matches. This adds more context and an extra degree of connection to every swipe Tinder claims. It is also preparing an overhaul of the way profiles look expanding the number of interests people can add. Earlier this month Tinder rolled out ‘Tinder Plus’ a premium service allowing people to ‘undo’ a like or change their location. A study has found that nearly two thirds of dating app users are men and one in five will pay for premium services. Sixteen to 34 year olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base. The study carried out by London based research firm GlobalWebIndex also found that six per cent of web users currently use a location based dating app. Significantly just a fifth of dating app users are paying for an online dating service co authors Jason Mander and Felim McGrath said in the report. But now they have set a limit on the number of ‘likes’ a user can perform in one day which seems to be set at 100. When a user reaches this limit the app tells them ‘You’re Out of Likes’ and gives a countdown clock until 24 hours are up so they can start swiping again. But below this clock a big red button says ‘Get Unlimited Likes with Tinder Plus’. A price is then shown. But different users are reporting the app is asking for different amounts. It seems the prices range from around GBP1.49 a month to as high as GBP14.99 but the reasons why are not clear. This means some users will pay GBP17.88 a year for Tinder Plus but others in the upper price category will have to fork out a whopping GBP179.88 a year. This equates to some users inadvertently paying GBP162 more than others over the course of a year. Speaking to MailOnline Rosette Pambakian Vice President of Communications and Branding at Tinder told MailOnline the app is testing out different price points ahead of a global release. We are testing Tinder Plus in select markets at various price points before rolling it out globally she said. The UK is one of our test markets so a certain portion of the population was given access to Tinder Plus at varying price points. However it is still not clear how the app decides how much to charge a user and whether it is based on location or activity. In addition Tinder has not commented on whether a user will receive a refund if they ultimately paid over the odds for the final price of the service.,"tinder has added the ability to let people add their latest instagram snaps to their profile.

SATISFIED Bill Clinton left was a famous lothario during his presidency even carrying on one affair with a White House intern . Time elapsed Less than three hours. His office confirmed on Friday that it was a Trump employee not a fat fingered CEO who was responsible. Mr. Trump was not responsible for this tweet a spokesperson told Daily Mail Online. It was retweeted by one of ten staff members that periodically help execute on Mr. Trump’s various social media platforms. As soon as Mr. Trump saw the tweet he deleted it the spokesperson added. Hillary Clinton s once strained relationship with her philandering husband is not likely to be the stuff of TV ads in the 2016 presidential race but the tweet suggests an undercurrent of crude jokes are being made at her expense. Sawyer Burmeister a Texas equestrian champion originated the line about Hillary Clinton s alleged inability to satisfy her randy husband Bill . Bill Clinton the 42nd U.S. president had an affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. He also famously caroused with other women who were not his wife going back to his days as the governor of Arkansas. A recent book about the staff who run the White House residence recounted a butler s story about hearing HIllary throw an object at him during the height of the Lewinsky saga. Taylor Burmeister who wrote the tweet about Hillary failing to satisfy Bill deleted it just before noon on Friday along with a second message.

Claims chemical signature proves James Ossuary was at Jerusalem site .
Chalk box bears inscription ‘James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus’
Find suggests Jesus fathered a child and was married .",An Israeli geologist claims he has ‘confirmed’ the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to Jesus and his son in Jerusalem. After extensive chemical tests Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary – a 1st century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of Jesus brother – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood. The research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place. Scroll down for video . After running 150 chemical tests an expert claims to have linked the James Ossuary pictured – a 1st century chalk box that was used for containing the bones of the dead – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood . According to geoarcheologist Dr Shimron the son of God was buried with nine other people including ‘Judah son of Jesus’ and his wife named Mary. Dr Shimron’s work has renewed controversy over the Talpiot tomb which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus The Jerusalem Post reported. Bones were discovered inside ossuaries including one that bore the inscription ‘Jesus son of Joseph . Others included the names Maria Joseph Mary Yose Matthew and most controversially ‘Judah son of Jesus’. Joseph Mary and Jesus were all common names at the time and a statistician from the University of Toronto said that they each made up eight per cent of the population. However a very small percentage would have had the same family name combination as described in the Bible. Dr Shimron’s work has renewed the controversy over the Talpiot tomb which was found in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus a portrait is pictured The long disputed long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood marked and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago . Probing this connection Dr Shimron and documentary maker Simcha Jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries including the James Ossuary which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription ‘James son of Joseph brother of Jesus’. The James Ossuary is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead. But it stands out because it bears the inscription James son of Joseph brother of Jesus on one side. The inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of Jesus . The existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002 but its authenticity was immediately challenged. The box s owner was charged with forging part of the inscription and while he was found innocent seven years later the judge said the acquittal does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2 000 years ago . Now Dr Shimron claims the chemical signature on the ‘crust’ of the box matches that of a tomb in Jerusalem known as the ‘Jesus Family tomb’ where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of Jesus and Mary as well as ‘Judah son of Jesus’. The owner of the ossuary Oded Golan was accused of forging the inscription shortly after its discovery by an academic from the Sorbonne in Paris but he was later found innocent. Other experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the Jerusalem tomb is connected with Jesus at all. Recently Dr Shimron gained access to the James Ossuary and scraped beneath the box s patina the layer that forms on metal over time. He ran around 150 tests on the chemistry of samples from 25 different ossuaries – 15 of which were from unrelated tombs – and found that traces of magnesium iron and silicon from the James Ossuary matched the chemical signature of Talpiot tomb. The Talpiot ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of ‘Rendzina’ soil which is characteristic of the hills of East Jerusalem when they were found and has a unique chemistry. Dr Shimron worked from the assumption that an earthquake of 363AD flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries effectively forming a vacuum and freezing them in time. Soil that seeped into the box matched that found in the Talpiot ossuaries indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the ‘holy’ location. Bones were discovered there in ossuaries or chalk boxes including one that bears the inscription ‘Jesus son of Joseph with others bearing the names of Maria Joseph Mary Yose Matthew and most controversially ‘Judah son of Jesus’. Here an inscription that says Yoseph on an ossuary . Because bones were found in the ossuaries it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection portrayed in this tapestry which is the belief of more traditional Christians while others accept the event was spiritual . Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals according to a writer and leading atheist activist. David Fitzgerald a San Francisco based author believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist. He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear. Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals according to a writer and leading atheist activist. A mosaic of Christ is shown . He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark Matthew and Luke claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus. Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence. Speaking to MailOnline he said There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years. Or it means he did not do all these things at all. The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray. I believe that Christianity started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old Gods and old traditions were rebooted. Christianity appears to have been a Jewish mystery faith. David Fitzgerald told MailOnline There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years . The famous statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro Brazil is shown . By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different Lord s suppers as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs. It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus. Mr Fitzgerald said There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person but I just do not think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all. We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time. There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria. During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus but all of them managed something Jesus did not to make a dent on the historical record. Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did. Jacobovici told The Jerusalem Post ‘This find illustrates that the James Ossuary is authentic and the Jesus Family tomb indeed belongs to the family of Jesus of Nazareth.’ Dr Shumron told The New York Times ‘I think I’ve got really powerful virtually unequivocal evidence that the James ossuary spent most of its lifetime or death time in the Talpiot Tomb.’ The retired senior researchers of the Geological Survey of Israel added ‘ The evidence is beyond what I expected.’ The duo are aware that the findings could rock the Christian church but insist the research is scientific and not theological. Because bones were found in the ossuaries it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection which is the belief of more traditional Christians while others accept the event was spiritual. The Talpiot tomb is now sealed under a concrete slab while the ossuaries found there are in the hands of the Israel Antiquities Authority. The James Ossuary is kept in a secret location by its owner who lives in Tel Aviv.,"an israeli geologist claims he has ‘ confirmed ’ the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to jesus and his son in jerusalem.

Several of her party's election pledges will overlap with Labour policies .
Others are calculated to drag a minority LAbour government to the left .
These include cancelling Trident and halting Tory changes to benefits .",Nicola Sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to ‘lead the UK’ as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor made for a power sharing deal with Labour. The SNP leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for British foreign policy welfare payments energy bills and English university tuition fees. Several of her election pledges overlap with Labour policy including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of GBP9 000 a year to GBP6 000 and rolling back competition in the English NHS. Others are calculated to drag a minority Labour government to the left including halting the roll out of Iain Duncan Smith’s popular changes to benefits and cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system. Scroll down for video . Control The Tories warn SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be Ed Miliband s puppet master if he becomes Prime Minister after the election . Several election pledges in Miss Sturgeon s manifesto overlap with Labour policy including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of GBP9 000 a year to GBP6 000 and rolling back competition in the English NHS . The SNP also wants the UK to formally recognise Palestine as a state give energy regulator Ofgem the power to force suppliers to cut prices and to increase public spending on infrastructure in northern England and Wales. At the heart of the SNP’s manifesto are plans for what Miss Sturgeon has called ‘modest’ spending increases funded by yet more borrowing – but which in fact total GBP180billion over five years. Scotland’s First Minister who is not herself running for a Westminster seat said yesterday the SNP had much in common with Left wing Labour MPs and aimed to build a ‘progressive alliance’ for people ‘right across the UK’. ‘There is an opportunity to build progressive alliances for progressive policies. It is a real rather than a pretend alternative to austerity ’ she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. Today’s SNP election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny. Polls suggest the party is on course for a landslide victory north of the border winning as many as 50 seats and holding the balance of power at Westminster. That could trigger constitutional turmoil of the sort that followed the 1910 election when Irish Nationalists surged and ended up with more than 70 seats. In the years that followed there was bitter conflict and the larger part of Ireland eventually seceded from the UK. The huge surge in support for the SNP could see senior Labour figures such as Jim Murphy left and Douglas Alexander right lose their seats . The latest Scotland wide YouGov survey shows the SNP on a record 49 per cent up three with Labour trailing on 25 per cent down four. The Conservatives were on 18 per cent and Liberal Democrats on just four per cent. The scale of the shift in traditional Labour strongholds in Scotland is unprecedented in modern European politics. Even senior Labour figures including the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and the shadow foreign secretary and the party’s election campaign coordinator Douglas Alexander are facing defeat. The SNP will declare today that a ‘strong team’ of SNP MPs in Westminster would help ‘rebalance the UK both politically and economically from the chronic over dominance of the City of London which has harmed the overall UK economy and left regions of England neglected’. Miss Sturgeon insisted those who had asked Scotland to remain in the UK in last year’s independence referendum could not now object to it calling the shots at Westminster. ‘We were told by leaders of the No campaign during the closing stages of the referendum debate that Scotland’s voice really mattered. Indeed we were told that Scotland shouldn’t leave the UK but lead the UK ’ she said. ‘So it is more than a bit rich now that Scotland has decided to remain part of the Westminster system for anyone in London or elsewhere to try and imply that Scotland’s voice shouldn’t be heard or that Scotland’s voice somehow becomes an illegitimate one if people here decide to elect a large number of SNP MPs.’ However the First Minister will face tough questions at today’s launch over her plans for ‘full fiscal autonomy’ or effective ‘home rule’ which would see almost every power apart from foreign affairs and defence devolved to Holyrood. It would end the generous Barnett Formula that funds Scotland. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has predicted that a ‘fiscally autonomous’ Scotland would have a GBP7.6billion black hole in its finances.,"nicola sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to ‘ lead the uk ’ as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor made for a power sharing deal with labour.

Almost half of 1 000 British companies questioned said they are less inclined to recruit an applicant after interview if they are obese or overweight. Among the reasons given were that overweight workers are unable to play a full role in the business they are lazy and they would not be able to do the job required the research shows. Beverley Sunderland managing director at Crosslands Employment Solicitors who commissioned the research said Our research shows that prejudiced attitudes towards hiring obese workers are rife among British employers. A survey of 1 000 British companies revealed almost half are less inclined to recruit an obese applicant fearing they are lazy and unable to fulfil their roles as required because of their weight . The findings come in the wake of a European court case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft 50 who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability if it hinders the full and effective participation of the person... on an equal basis with other workers when doing their job. Body Mass Index calculated from a person s weight and height is accepted as a reliable indicator of obesity. According to the World Health Organisation the ideal BMI for most adults is between 18.5 and 24.9. If a person s BMI is 25 to 29.9 they are classed as overweight. At between 30 and 39.9 they are obese and 40 or over is very – or morbidly – obese. Doctors say being overweight or obese can increase the risk of health problems including heart disease strokes type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Earlier this year the European Court of Justice s advocate general Niilo Jaaskinen who advises the court suggested that very severe obesity – classified as a BMI of more than 40 – could be considered a disability. But yesterday s ruling does not state what level of obesity would be classed as disabled . It stated It is for the national court to determine whether an individual s obesity falls within the definition of disability . Ms Sunderland said following the case it appears on the face of it that the odds are against you getting a job if you are overweight . But the law is on your side as discrimination law warns against making stereotypical assumptions at every stage of the recruitment process and this applies to both existing employees or people applying for a job she added. Given the ruling at the European Courts of Justice employers now have to find way to accommodate obese workers who fall within this definition of disability while larger job applicants need to ensure they are not discriminated against Ms Sunderland said. Critics at the time warned it could encourage the overweight to avoid slimming down in the hope of securing a payout. Companies could also face millions of pounds of costs to alter offices and factories including providing . The survey revealed 61 per cent of employers were worried about the potential costs to the business of accommodating the side effects of overweight staff. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability after a case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft 50 pictured who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat . Sixty three per cent also cited a fear of being taken to court on grounds of discrimination if the disability needs of obese workers were not met. Just over a quarter 26 per cent said they were less inclined to hire obese people due to their lack of awareness of the laws linked to employing overweight workers. Yet the lack of understanding of the law could land employers in hot water Ms Sunderland warned. More than half of employers questioned were unaware that if an obese person tells an employer about their long term conditions at interview and the company does not employ them the applicant could try to claim disability discrimination on the basis their obesity prevented them being employed.,"obese workers are lazy and unable to fulfil their roles and as a result are less likely to be hired a new survey has revealed.

The print itself is inspired by Asian culture and one of its most recognisable symbols. I’ve contrasted that with the fit basketball style cuts which were inspired by American culture. My White Smoke pack is about the body mind soul connection about taking a moment for reflection. The graphic comes from the visual smoke creates when burning incense.

Each one of my packs has a different cut and style to it she explained. I’m more of a tomboy myself but I also love to get dressed up and wear a big dress so my designs embody that contrast.

Adidas has always been a staple in my closet so it was a natural fit for me to collaborate with them I’m just grateful they wanted to work with me! .

It’s great to be able to give a try to so many different things. I’m just starting to get more into the Hollywood movie world so I’d love to continue down that path.

Swiss police seized bot after it purchased 10 ecstasy tablets from Germany .
It was later released 'without charge' according to the artists behind the bot .
They designed it as part of an art exhibition to display items bought by the robot over the dark net including trainers, a passport scan and cigarettes .",A robot has been arrested by Swiss police after it bought a supply of illegal drugs on a hidden region of the internet known as the dark net . The automated computer program was designed as an online shopping system that would spend up to USD100 each week by randomly purchasing an item offered for sale on the deep web. The robot would then have its purchase mailed to a group of artists who then put the items in an exhibition in the town of St Gallen in north east Switzerland. The Random Darknet Shopper purchased a number of items for sale on the deep web pictured including trainers jeans cigarettes a set of masterkeys and a DVD case far left containing 10 ecstasy tablets . The items it bought included a pair of Nike trainers counterfeit designer jeans the scan of a Hungarian passport and a set of UK Fire Brigade masterkeys. However it seems the Random Darknet Shopper crossed the line when it purchased 10 Ecstasy tablets which arrived in a vacuum packed bag hidden in a DVD case. The dark net is a subsection of the deep web the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines which are rather like dragging a net across the surface of the sea missing much of the information in the depths. The dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website and its successor that were recently shut down was used to sell drugs in exchange for bitcoins the electronic currency. Other dark net sites allow users to share pornographic photographs hacked information credit card numbers and other illegal goods. The Silk Road used an underground computer network known as the The Onion Router TOR which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption hiding the IP address and the activity of the user. Just 0.26 per cent of the daily internet traffic from the UK accesses this hidden part of the internet. Police seized the drugs the computer and the rest of the items it had purchased. Tests on the tablets later revealed they contained 90mg of the class A drug MDMA which the police then destroyed. The computer and the empty bag the ecstasy came in have now been returned to the group behind the bot !Mediengruppe Bitnik along with the other items it bought. They described the police s actions as an unjustified intervention into the freedom of art . Writing on their blog London based artists Carmen Weisskopf and Domagoj Smoljo who were behind the project said Random Darknet Shopper has finally been released and is now back in our possession. At the same time we also received the order for withdrawal of prosecution. In the order for withdrawal of prosecution the public prosecutor states that the possession of Ecstasy was indeed a reasonable means for the purpose of sparking public debate about questions related to the exhibition. The public prosecution also asserts that the overweighing interest in the questions raised by the art work Random Darknet Shopper justify the exhibition of the drugs as artefacts even if the exhibition does hold a small risk of endangerment of third parties through the drugs exhibited. We as well as the Random Darknet Shopper have been cleared of all charges. This is a great day for the bot for us and for freedom of art! The Random Darknet Shopper project was set up as an attempt to highlight some of the dilemmas that can be thrown up by dark net markets and anonymous internet use. It used Bitcoin to randomly purchase items that were offered for sail in the darknet. The tablets pictured above were sent from Germany inside a DVD case and a vacuum sealed foil bag . They were delivered to the artists by mail and then put on display in an exhibition at the Kunst Halle in St Gallen. During the weeks it had been running it also purchased a fake Louis Vuitton handbag a baseball cap with a hidden camera and 200 Chesterfield cigarettes. The darknet market features more than 16 000 items that are sold in a way that allows the seller to remain anonymous. The ecstasy tablets were found to contain 90mg of MDMA and were destroyed by the Swiss authorities . It has become notorious as a place to buy illegal pornography drugs and weapons. The robot software bought the ecstasy in October. It was sent from Germany to Switzerland and apparently crossed the border hidden in a DVD case without being intercepted by the authorities. The drugs were allowed to remain on show in the exhibition until it ended in January. However the police raided the exhibition when it came to an end and seized the computer and its purchases on the grounds the drugs were an endangerment of third parties. Speaking to the Guardian Mr Smoljo said that they had been told although the computer had purchased the drugs itself they were the legal owners of the drugs as they had executed the code behind the software. The case has raised important questions about the use of automatic shopping bots and the use of the darknet. In the past the artists have used technology to intercept CCTV images and sent a package to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.

The sum is almost five times the Prime Minister’s GBP142 500 pay packet – and comes as thousands of patients struggle to get on the books of NHS practices.

The figures lay bare the huge amounts of taxpayers’ money paid to dentists for NHS work following Labour’s introduction of controversial contracts in 2006. Scroll down for video . Lucrative Some dentists earn from multiple NHS contracts as well as private patients . Campaigners said the payments were ‘scandalous’ and ‘unacceptable’. Under freedom of information laws the NHS Business Services Authority was asked about the pensionable pay of dentists who do NHS work. In 2012/13 the latest figures available five practitioners were paid more than GBP500 000. They shared a total of about GBP3.4million – an average of GBP690 000. This comes on top of any money they take from treating patients privately. Another 11 earned GBP400 000 to GBP499 999 from the NHS 30 received GBP300 000 to GBP399 999 131 pocketed GBP200 000 to GBP299 999 and 1 617 received GBP100 000 to GBP199 999. Katherine Murphy of the Patients Association said the rates of pay were ‘exorbitant’. Yesterday s Daily Mail . She added ‘Investment is urgently needed on the front line where there is a desperate shortage of nurses and patients waiting for hours in A&E ... when the NHS is under such huge financial pressure this type of spending on huge salaries is unacceptable.’ It follows revelations in Thursday’s Mail that millions of pounds was being wasted on NHS prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Yesterday the Mail also exposed a GBP2 700 charge for cataract surgery at some hospitals – treble the cost to the health service – raising suspicions that patients are being ripped off. Patient Concern’s Roger Goss said ‘This is scandalous. People will be shocked to hear the sums lining dentists’ pockets when it is almost impossible to find dental care on the NHS in some parts of the country. ‘There is something strange going on when the NHS will pay for gastric bands suncream and hangover tablets yet it is so difficult to get dental treatment on it. It is almost perverse.’ Jonathan Isaby of the Taxpayers Alliance which the Mail commissioned to carry out the research said the salaries show a ‘shameless public sector elite taking taxpayers for a ride’. He added ‘It is outrageous that these telephone number salaries have been hidden from the people who pay them ... Taxpayers expect the money they put in to the NHS to be spent on patients not on bumper pay packets.’ The contracts brought in by Labour were designed to improve access to NHS dentistry. But patients are still struggling to get an appointment. The pay deals gave practitioners a fixed sum for a set amount of work agreed at the start of the year rather than separate incomes for the number of patients treated or procedures done. Thursday s Daily Mail . Treatments are divided into three bands from a simple check up earning the dentist GBP25 to procedures such as fitting dentures and crowns for roughly GBP300. The value of a contract can run to millions of pounds and some dentists run more than one practice so hold multiple contracts. According to the Health and Social Care Information Centre 21 500 dentists did NHS work in 2012/13 but most also do substantial amounts of private work. The British Dental Association’s Mick Armstrong said the top earning dentists ‘most likely own a group of practices’ or are specialists in their area. But Tory Charlotte Leslie who sat on the health select committee of MPs said ‘Most people will be absolutely stunned individual clinicians are getting such astronomical salaries on the NHS.’ A spokesman for NHS England said it contracts the vast majority of dental services from self employed individuals or companies some of whom ‘earn income from a number of contracts’.,"britain s five highest earning nhs dentists are paid average salaries of gbp690 000 a year.

Labour has left the door open to borrowing an extra £26billion-a-year .
Tories were accused of giving 'no detail' about £30billion of spending cuts .
Boost for Osborne as he beats borrowing target by £3billion in last year .",Voters are still in the dark about the scale and depth of spending cuts being planned by all the main parties with just two weeks until polling day economic experts warned today. Analysts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said none of the major parties had given anything like full details on how they will tackle the nations debts after the election. The Tories were accused of giving no detail about their deficit reduction plan which relies on GBP30billion of cuts while Labour has left the door open to borrowing an extra GBP26billion a year. Scroll down for video . The Institute for Fiscal Studies analysed the policies of all the main parties to see how their policies would increase borrowing . The IFS warned that the promise of tackling the deficit in the next Parliament is based on almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases . The think tank reached its conclusions after a detailed study of the party manifestos ahead of May s General Election. It accused Tory Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls of failing to spell out exactly where the axe will fall. IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said There are genuinely big differences between the main parties fiscal plans. The electorate has a real choice although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice. Conservative plans involve a significantly larger reduction in borrowing and debt than Labour plans. But they are predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases. While Labour has been considerably less clear about its overall fiscal ambition its stated position appears to be consistent with little in the way of further spending cuts after this year. Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls are accused of not spelling out how they will tackle the deficit . George Osborne received a pre election boost today as official figures showed he beat his target for reducing annual public sector borrowing for the latest financial year by nearly GBP3 billion. Borrowing excluding the effect of bank bailouts was GBP87.3 billion for the year to the end of March down from GBP98.5 billion in 2013/14 according to the Office for National Statistics ONS . The result undershot the latest target of GBP90.2 billion set by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility OBR at the time of last month s Budget. It means that annual borrowing GDP has fallen by more than GBP60 billion from GBP153.5 billion in 2009/10 just before the Coalition came to power. As a percentage of gross domestic product GDP it has dropped by half from 10.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent. However underlying debt of GBP1.48 trillion is more than GBP500 billion higher than the 2009/10 figure of GBP956 billion. The nation s debt represents 80.4 per cent of GDP up from 62 per cent five years ago. The IFS analysis said the Tories planned the largest reduction in borrowing over the course of the next Parliament. It said the party would require large spending cuts or tax increases to achieve this. Research economist Soumaya Keynes said The Conservatives have said they want to eliminate the deficit but provided next to no detail on how they would do it. They should be forthcoming on the GBP5 billion of largely unspecified clampdown on tax avoidance the GBP10 billion of unspecified cuts to social security spending and according to our calculations further real cuts to unprotected departments of around GBP30 billion. Turning to Labour the IFS said the Opposition had been considerably more vague about how much it wants to borrow. The pledge to produce a surplus but without specifying by when or how much could be consistent with a reduction in borrowing totalling 3.6 per cent of national income. Senior research economist Rowena Crawford said Labour s proposed measures might be broadly enough to meet their target for only borrowing to invest. But this would leave borrowing at GBP26billion a year in today s terms. If Labour wanted to reduce borrowing to a lower level than this they would have to spell out more detail of how they would get there. The IFS said the Liberal Democrats had been more transparent about overall fiscal plans to 2017 18 revealing that they are aiming for a tightening more than Labour but less than the Conservatives. The SNP s figures imply the same reduction in borrowing as Labour the IFS said although the reduction would be slower. This means the SNP is proposing a slower but longer period of austerity the think tank said. The independent analysis came as the main parties clashed over the economy with Labour accusing the Tories of planning the biggest spending cuts in any of the world s advanced economies and the Conservatives renewing warnings that Britain s economy would suffer from an SNP/Miliband nightmare . Labour s Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said The IFS has confirmed that the Tories are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years. The Tories might be able to make the cuts but the last five years show they will fail to cut the deficit as they claim. They have borrowed GBP200 billion more than they planned because their failure to boost living standards has led to tax revenues falling short. But Mr Osborne today warned that every family in the country will be left GBP350 worse off if the SNP is left calling the shots in a Labour government. The Chancellor warned of a dangerous cocktail if Ed Miliband is at the mercy of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. With polls showing no party will win an overall majority Mr Osborne claimed it would spark a constitutional crisis if Scottish nationalist MPs held the balance of power in the UK government. Launching the SNP manifesto this week Ms Sturgeon named her price for supporting Labour in any post election deal. She demanded her MPs have a say over the running of the whole of the UK raising the prospect of Scottish nationalists calling the shots on policies which only apply south of the border. And she unveiled a GBP140billion ransom note for Britain to drag Labour to the left including an end to austerity rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Mr Miliband would have to pay for getting into Number 10. Mr Osborne seized on the demand for more spending and more borrowing and warned that Treasury analysis suggests it would add GBP6billion to Britain s interest bill worth GBP350 per family. Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4 s Today programme It s a new feature of this election that a Labour party cannot win an overall majority so they would rely on this deeply unstable block of Scottish Nationalists. We have got a strong plan for a national recovery but it s perfectly reasonable to point out with two weeks to go until this election the alternative is what Gordon Brown described last night as constitutional chaos . The Scottish Nationalist leaders would clearly be the stronger force in a Labour minority government propped up by them. Jonathan Isaby chief executive of the TaxPayers Alliance said The politicians seeking our votes owe it to taxpayers to come clean about what spending the country can and cannot afford. This candour has so far been noticeably absent in the election campaign with politicians failing to acknowledge the dire state of the public finances and instead clambering over each other to make additional and apparently unfunded spending pledges.

But what trainers should you go for Running is often celebrated as a budget sport because you do not have to pay expensive gym fees or buy lots of equipment. But trainers can be costly proved by the latest adidas Boost shoes that have gone on sale for GBP130. Femail writer and marathon runner Lucy Waterlow tested out GBP130 adidas Ultra Boost trainers against Aldi s budget GBP19.99 pair ahead of the London Marathon next week . In contrast supermarket chain Aldi have a running flash sale in stores from tomorrow Thursday with trainers available for the budget price of GBP19.99 while stocks last. The shoes you run in are important to prevent injuries and ensure you have a comfortable and enjoyable experience so can you really get the same results from a cheap supermarket pair over the costly version from a major sports brand FEMAIL asked Lucy Waterlow a marathoner with a personal best time of 3.06 and co writer of Nell McAndrew s Guide To Running to take them for a test run... THE TRAINERS . Adidas Ultra Boost GBP130 Adidas promise to deliver your greatest run ever with their new trainer which features their much hyped Boost technology. This is a type of cushioning that the sports brand have developed that looks like polystyrene and offers support and comfort to the wearer. Adidas say the Boost cushioning also gives energy return so the wearer can run more effortlessly. The adidas Boost technology is a type of cushioning that they say will deliver your greatest run ever while the Primeknit fabric is said to allow the natural expansion of any foot shape At GBP130 the shoes only offer value for money if you intend to run in them often but the bumpy undersole does not seem to be that durable . It certainly seems to have worked for the numerous elite athletes including Jessica Ennis who have worn Boost trainers thanks to sponsorship deals. Wilson Kipsang wore the adidas Adizero Adios version when he ran what was then a World Record time of 2 03 23 in Berlin in 2013. Speaking of the Ultra Boost version which have been on sale since February at a RRP of GBP130 adidas executive Eric Liedtke said Ultra BOOST represents the culmination of years of work and meticulous research striving to create the greatest running shoe ever. All of the very best in adidas technology has been combined to create a shoe that provides industry leading Energy Return alongside unprecedented adaptability and comfort. Aldi Premium Running Shoes GBP19.99 The premium running shoes are part of the Aldi s latest Specialbuys running range under the label Crane which will be in stores from 16th April and available while stocks last. It s not the first time Aldi have sold running trainers as a non premium version went on sale for GBP14.99 in 2013. Aldi s GBP19.99 premium running shoes for women comes in a turquoise and pink shade . The men s version is royal blue and will only be available in stores while stocks last . Aldi say their running range is high spec despite the low prices as they keep their costs down by stocking their own products over big brands having minimalist store interiors to reduce overheads and charging for plastic bags. The supermarket chain are not in the business of sponsoring elite athletes so can not lay claim to helping Olympians to medals or World Records with their shoes. LUCY S VERDICT APPEARANCE . Adidas The trainers come in black with purple embellishment for both men and women and are made using adidas Primeknit fabric which is said to allow the natural expansion of any foot shape. The dark colour makes a refreshing change for women who are often only offered running shoes in pink and pastel shades while the Primeknit fabric does look stylish and professional. The Boost cushioning encompasses the shoe a bit like a hovercraft so they do not make your feet look small and dainty. But while friends I met for a run did observe my feet looked big in the trainers they also admired the fashionable appearance of the shoe. Aldi The supermarket s trainers look the part and come in a bright turquoise and pink shade for women and royal blue for men. The appearance is reminiscent of Brooks popular Adrenaline running shoes so friends did not guess they were made by Aldi until I told them. The Aldi trainers feature reflective material which is great for being seen when running at night but the rest of the fabric used does look cheap. The outsole looks bulky and plastic so it does not look like it will have much give when running. LUCY S VERDICT FIT AND RUNNING FEEL . Adidas The shoes have a tongue at the back of the heel so they can be pulled on easily and the Primeknit fabric makes it feel you are putting your foot into a comfortable sock. The laces are sleek and elastic so can be easily tied for a snug fit. Adidas shoes can often come up small so it s advisable to buy a pair half a size larger than your usual shoe size. In doing so I found my pair to be a perfect fit. My toes had plenty of space at the front so they did not pinch when my foot pushed forward when I was running and they were not too lose at the heel so they did not rub. Often after trying new running shoes blisters can form but this wasn t the case even after a nine mile run in the shoes. The Boost cushioning gives a comfortable and springy feel and despite its bulky appearance the shoes do not feel too heavy on the foot while running. Lucy found the Boost trainers left fitted well and felt comfortable on a long run while the Aldi trainers right were adequate but felt bulkier and were not as snug a fit . Aldi The shoes are not available in half sizes so I opted for my usual shoe size despite this they still felt too big. I ran in the same running socks I had worn when running in the adidas trainers but felt I could have used a thicker pair in order for the shoes to fit better. The trainers were not a snug fit so I felt I had too much room around my forefoot and tightening the laces further did not help alleviate the roomy feel. Wearing thicker socks did help but I still felt my feet were sliding around a bit too much. However they did not rub so I again did not suffer from any blisters but they did feel less comfortable and were not as well fitted as the adidas pair. The trainers also felt heavier on my feet than the Boost. Overall they felt more sturdy then the adidas pair and I did not feel like they adapted to my feet in the same way running in them for a short run was fine but I would not feel comfortable wearing them for a long run or when doing speed work. LUCY S OVERALL VERDICT . To my surprise the Aldi shoes on the whole looked and felt the part although the fit wasn t ideal. I d recommend these to runners on a budget who are just starting out who may just be running two or three times a week and are not sure yet if they will stick with it. At GBP19.99 if you do not carry on running if your motivation wanes you will not be too much out of pocket. The supportiveness of the shoes also means they would be suitable to wear at the gym or for walking. However if you intend to carry on running I d recommend going to a specialist running shop to be fitted for a shoe exactly to your foot type. They can analyse your running style to see if you need any extra support. The adidas shoes felt comfortable and I was happy running in them for miles. Although they feel a little too bulky for speedwork they are great for steady runs and I would run a marathon in them. I am not convinced this Ultra Boost model is worth the GBP130 price tag though unless you can run in them often to get value for money. I am also not convinced that the unusual bumpy undersole they have will be that durable after just a few runs the rubber has shown signs of wear. What I convinced by was the cushioning provided by the Boost technology. But in the future I would be more likely to buy the Adizero Adios version for speedwork and racing as they are lighter in weight and not as expensive as their Ultra counterparts.,"marathon season is in full swing with the london marathon set to take place a week on sunday.

Inquest hears that the power supply was not clearly marked as dangerous .",An apprentice electrician fell off a ladder and died in front of his father after he was electrocuted while testing lights in a factory an inquest has heard. Nathan Brown 19 was working with his father David an experienced electrician when he apparently touched a set of exposed electrical bars powering a crane. The shock caused him to fall 12ft head first onto the roof of a toilet block below the crane. He was airlifted to hospital but later died from his injuries. Tragic Apprentice electrician Nathan Brown died after being electrocuted while testing lights . Accident Nathan fell 12ft from a ladder after being electrocuted and later died of his injuries . The inquest in Oldham heard that Nathan described by his family as a cheeky happy boy trained to become an electrician so he could follow in his father s footsteps. The pair were both working at Eurofabs UK Ltd a sheet metal manufacturer in Rochdale Greater Manchester when tragedy struck in September 2013. Nathan was told to climb up a ladder onto the walkway of a crane and test the lights in the building s roof taking readings and shouting them down to his father a task as easy as plugging in a television. But he accidentally touched a 400 volt busbar a metal strip which conducts electricity within a switchboard while he was trying to climb high enough to carry out the tests. Forensic pathologist Philip Lumb told the inquest he found burn marks consistent with electrocution on Nathan s arm. Family The 19 year old was working with his father David an experienced electrician at the time of his death . He said I gather Nathan was an apprentice electrician who was working for his father and contracted by a company called Eurofabs to conduct a complete electrical inspection. One of his duties was to inspect one part of the roof. In order to gain access Nathan had to get on top of a toilet block and place a ladder against an electrical crane to access the platform where the lights were located. His father was working in the premises at the time. A short time late his father saw Nathan fall head first into the roof of the toilet block about 12ft. He did not note any sounds of attempts to break his fall. He went to attend to him but found him in a collapsed condition although his father said he may be able to feel a pulse. Dr Lumb told the inquest the cause of Nathan s death was electrocution and that he probably suffered cardiac arrest before falling to the ground. His mother Nicole 47 said she learnt of the accident when she was called by her other son Gary who worked at Eurofabs. She told the inquest He said Do not panic mum but Nathan has had a fall. I remember saying Why what happened He said He has fallen from a ladder. I asked if he was OK and he said he did not know as he wasn t conscious. He said You need to get here as soon as you can mum. I just rushed out the house and got on the car and drove straight over. I remember running up the stairs to get to him. I just got more or less up the stairs and I saw the paramedics trying to save him. Workplace Nathan and his father were carrying out electrical tests at Eurofabs UK in Rochdale . In a statement Mr Brown 50 who has been an electrician for 32 years said that his son had joined him as an apprentice in September 2012 after embarking on a three year training course and had completed health and safety training a month before the fatal accident. He said As an apprentice he was learning on the job and only ever allowed to complete basic tasks such as basic electrics switches sockets and lights. You would only ever allow Nathan to carry out work when safe for him to do so and work within capability knowledge and competence. Mr Brown said he had carried out work at the Eurofabs premises twice before and on this occasion was carrying out a general electrical survey which he likened to an MOT. He said he decided to put a ladder over the toilet block beneath a 10 tonne travelling crane and had not seen the busbar overhead. He told the inquest As far as I am aware the busbar should have been marked up in a sleeve with the marking danger high voltage . I have never come across a busbar not sleeved and marked with an appropriate sign. Had I been aware of the presence of the busbars in such unprotected conditions then I would not have continued to take this work. In all 32 years experience with busbars I have seen them properly protected and never come across exposed busbars as present on the day of the accident. That was the worst and fastest day of my life. It s a blur but I can not get rid of some of those thoughts. The test he was doing would be as simple as plugging a TV into a wall. I am completely devastated by the accident and life will never be the same again. He was the light of my life and my family and I will miss him so much. Time is a great healer and I hope that will be the case.

Polls suggest neither Tories or Labour will manage to win a majority .
Fears the pound could fall another 10% if a badly hung parliament .",The pound has slipped to a five year low against the dollar amid growing uncertainty about the outcome of the general election. But the pound fell to near 1.46 against the US dollar its lowest level since June 2010 just after the last election when no party secured a majority. Different polls have variously put the Tories and Labour narrowly ahead with David Cameron and Ed Miliband both facing the prospect of having to rely on smaller parties to form a government. The pound fell to near 1.46 against the US dollar its lowest level since June 2010 just after the last election when no party secured a majority . Experts have warned of the impact on the economy of a badly hung parliament with neither major party able to form a stable government. There are fears it could sent pound plummeting by another 10 per cent. Today’s fall in the value of the pound was also impacted by figures showing industrial production grew by just 0.1 per cent in February. Construction shrank by 0.9 per cent following a 2.5 per cent contraction in January. It was suggested that the figures pointed to overall growth slowing to 0.4 per cent for the first quarter down from 0.6 per cent in the last three months of 2014. That would be the weakest pace of growth since the end of 2013. Labour have made gains in a series of opinion polls enjoying leads in three and cutting the Conservative lead in another. The latest survey also contains good news for the Liberal Democrats who gain three points to draw level with Ukip for the first time in more than 18 months. Based on the 2010 election result David Cameron needs to win another 23 more seats to secure a majority in the Commons while Ed Miliband needs at least 70. Nick Clegg is defending 56 seats but is braced for heavy losses . ComRes research for ITV and the Daily Mail suggested the race was still too tight to call with the Tories on 34 per cent and Labour on 33 per cent but that compared with a four point deficit for Ed Miliband s Opposition at the start of the campaign. Other polls gave Labour leads of between three and six points and one suggested that for the first time voters thought Ed Miliband was doing a better job than David Cameron. The Opposition gained two points on last week in the Survation poll for the Mirror while the Conservatives dipped one to move ahead by 35 per cent to 31 per cent. The Labour leader despite still trailing his Tory rival as the best to be prime minister by 37 per cent to 25 per cent will be delighted at their latest personal approval ratings after lagging consistently behind throughout most of his leadership. A hard hitting report by BlackRock the largest fund manager in the world said last week that ‘a soothing outcome for the markets is hard to imagine’ given Labour’s anti business policies and Tory plans to hold a referendum on Britain’ s membership of the European Union. ‘Labour would be tough on business – and might be perceived as lacking fiscal responsibility ’ the US giant said in the report. ‘A Conservatives dominated Cabinet would pave the way for an unsettling referendum in 2017 on the UK’s EU membership. ‘Whoever wins – and the result could take some time to emerge – will lead a weak government likely to pass only watered down legislation.’ BlackRock which invests in major British companies such as Tesco said weeks of horse trading to form a government would be ‘harrowing for the UK’.,"the pound has slipped to a five year low against the dollar amid growing uncertainty about the outcome of the general election.

His mother had called police to help take mentally ill son to hospital .
Police claim he attacked them with 'deadly force' using broom handle .
But footage from scene  appears to show Hall running away from cops .",Damning footage has revealed the moment a Florida police officer shouted Get on the f****** ground or you are dead moments before he shot a mentally ill man as he was running away. The family of Lavall Hall released the shocking video which calls into question the Miami Gardens police department s account of the incident on February 15. The clip captured from the police car at the scene shows shell cases flying as a police officer shot the 25 year old schizophrenic who was black on February 15. The police department said the officers were forced to shoot because Hall attacked them with deadly force using the broom but the video footage appears to show him trying to flee the officers before he was fatally shot. Footage captured from within a police car at the scene show shell cases flying as police officer Eddie Trimino fatally shot schizophrenic 25 year old Lavall Hall who was black outside his home in Miami Gardens . Attorneys for Hall s family released the 19 minutes of dash cam video yesterday afternoon at a press conference and claim it shows Hall was being chased by police before he was shot at five times. Hall who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder had been released from a mental hospital just one week earlier and was suffering from a psychotic episode when his mother Catherine Daniels called police to take him to a mental health unit reports Fusion. Hall s family have now filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court in Miami against the city of Miami Gardens and the two police officers Peter Ehrlich and Eddo Trimino. According to the complaint Ms Daniels had previously called police for help with her son and the department was aware of his condition alleging excessive use of force by police and wrongful death. An officer can be heard shouting Get on the f****** ground or you are dead on the police car footage . Hall who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder had been released from a mental hospital just one week before the shooting . The footage shot from inside the car appears to show Hall running past the car with two officers in pursuit . Hall was unable to communicate clearly did not understand what was going on and was visibly scared it said. Two of the five bullets fired hit Hall Miami Gardens police told reporters in the days after the incident explaining that Hall had attacked officers with the broom. But Hall s lawyers argue that the police used excessive force after he ran away from them. His lawyers said Hall was holding the broomstick and dressed only in his underpants but the video shows he can be seen running from the police. Ms Daniels said at a news conference yesterday I never thought they were going to kill my child murder my child adding she was devastated when she first saw the video. Catherine Daniels Lavall s mother is hugged by her cousin Alfonzo Hill at the news conference yesterday . He was standing outside just holding the broomstick in his hand Daniels said. And I told him Baby come back inside it s cold. As the video played at the news conference one of the attorneys for the family said Ms Daniels can be heard telling police before the shooting Please do not hurt my child please ABC news reported. Her attorney added The officers had made up their minds that they were going to kill Lavall before this incident took place. They killed him murdered him said Melissa Edwards the mother of Hall s daughter at the news conference. An attorney for Eddo Trimino the officer involved told the Miami Herald the video indicated that the officer had shot out of fear. The lawyer for the officers argues they acted appropriately and claims Hall attacked them with deadly force . The video was released amid national protests over a series of deaths resulting from police use of force most recently with another video showing a white South Carolina police officer shooting an apparently unarmed black man in the back. People are saddened and angered but also exasperated that we are again seeing the devaluation of black lives on streets of the United States said Muhammed Malik organizer of the Miami Committee on State Violence. A spokesman for Florida State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told ABC News that the investigation is ongoing but they have concerns the video may endanger the investigation. Oscar Marrero attorney for the officers told ABC News The officers were faced with a dangerous situation. They have already given statements to investigators indicating Mr. Hall struck them with a weapon and deadly force was used. The reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene.

Phones and tablets were a dangerous distraction for parents, they claimed .
Kids with distracted carers were more likely to engage in risky behaviour .
This included jumping off moving swings or going head-first down slides .",Mobile phones and tablet computers are becoming dangerous distractions for parents who are supposed to be supervising their children researchers claim. A study found youngsters were more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them were distracted – with texting or talking on the phone a common cause. Researchers observed randomly selected parents with children who looked between 18 months and five years old at playgrounds in New York. Children are more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them are distracted by texting or talking on the phone the study showed file picture They measured factors such as the adult’s level of engagement with the child and how distracted they seemed. The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head first. Children whose carers were distracted were ‘significantly’ more likely to behave in this way. The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head first and found children whose carers were distracted were ‘significantly’ more likely to behave in this way . Electronic devices such as mobile phones were responsible for 30 per cent of all parental distractions. Three children fell while the researchers were observing them although none was seriously hurt. Study author Ruth Milanaik of Cohen Children’s Medical Centre in New York called on gadget obsessed parents to keep a closer eye on their offspring saying ‘Increased awareness of limiting electronic distractions and other activities that interfere with supervision should be considered.’ A neuroscientist claims that modern technology such as computer tablets and mobile phones could be changing the way our brains work . Professor Susan Greenfield warned that unless people wake up to the damage that the gadget filled pharmaceutically enhanced 21st century may be doing to our brains we could be sleepwalking towards a future in which neuro chip technology blurs the line between living and non living machines and between our bodies and the outside world. Electronic devices such as mobile phones and computer tablets could be anging the way our brains work according to a neuroscientist . She said One vital fact I have learnt is that the brain is not the unchanging organ that we might imagine. It not only goes on developing changing and in some tragic cases eventually deteriorating with age it is also substantially shaped by what we do to it and by the experience of daily life. When I say shaped I am not talking figuratively or metaphorically I am talking literally. At a microcellular level the infinitely complex network of nerve cells that make up the constituent parts of the brain actually change in response to certain experiences and stimuli. The brain in other words is malleable not just in early childhood but right up to early adulthood and in certain instances beyond. The surrounding environment has a huge impact both on the way our brains develop and how that brain is transformed into a unique human mind. Of course there s nothing new about that human brains have been changing adapting and developing in response to outside stimuli for centuries. But in the last century development of new technologies has increased dramatically. This will affect our brains over the next 100 years in ways we might never have imagined she said. Our brains are under the influence of an ever expanding world of new technology multichannel television video games MP3 players the internet wireless networks Bluetooth links the list goes on and on. This games driven generation interpret the world through screen shaped eyes. It s almost as if something has not really happened until it s been posted on Facebook Bebo or YouTube. We could be raising a hedonistic generation who live only in the thrill of the computer generated moment and are in distinct danger of detaching themselves from what the rest of us would consider the real world. Electronic devices and pharmaceutical drugs all have an impact on the micro cellular structure and complex biochemistry of our brains. And that in turn affects our personality our behaviour and our characteristics. In short the modern world could well be altering our human identity.,"mobile phones and tablet computers are becoming dangerous distractions for parents who are supposed to be supervising their children researchers claim.

Victim Fife council workers looked at Mikaeel Kular s left confidential files after he was killed by his mother Rosdeep Adekoya right Police Scotland probed the claims and an internal investigation was launched by Fife Council last year when up to 25 staff were alleged to have accessed confidential social work files belonging to the youngster. It has now been revealed at least nine workers were subject to disciplinary action and subsequently dismissed after looking at documents relating to the high profile case without permission. Adekoya who had frequently left her children home alone to go to nightclubs and take cocaine was jailed for 11 years in August last year but could be free within seven. She repeatedly beat her son before putting his lifeless body in a suitcase and leaving it in woodland behind her sister s home.

Five thousand local residents signed a petition protesting against the failure of prosecutors to pursue a murder charge against her. Social services were also widely criticised for failing Mikaeel after it emerged he was twice taken into care by social workers. At the time of the trial the court was told how Fife social services monitored Adekoya and her young family until December 2013 – the month before Mikaeel s death.

He told her he could make a call and help her stay in Britain, court hears .
Sergeant then allegedly attacked the teenager and nearly suffocated her .
Mee, 46, denies carrying out a string of rapes and sexual assaults .",Rape Edwin Jock Mee is accused of attacking several Army cadets while working as a recruitment sergeant . An Army recruiting sergeant raped a teenage cadet after telling her he could help her get a visa from the Home Office a court heard today. Edwin Jock Mee allegedly told the 18 year old from Sierra Leone that her visa application had been delayed in order to persuade her to have sex with him. He is accused of carrying out sex attacks on 11 victims as young as 15 while working at an Army careers centre in Croydon south London between October 2010 and September 2011. One woman told Southwark Crown Court today that she saw Mee 46 as a father figure after he helped her join the Army. She said He was like someone I could really lean on because going for some interviews with him he would ask me everything about my personal life everything because he said that is the procedure they need to do. So it is like I took him as a father or someone I can relate to or maybe understand what is happening to me. Jurors heard that Mee repeatedly asked the teenager if she wanted to have sex with him she initially ignored him but later explicitly told him she did not want to do. The court heard that one occasion when she went to see Mee he slapped her bottom as she left the office and she told him never do that . Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC asked the woman why she did not tell any of the other recruiters what was going on. The witness replied He always told me not to say anything to anyone because no one will believe me and looking at him and his status all these things I believed him. Describing the alleged rape the woman said she had gone in for her final Army selection interview in August 2011 before the conclusion of the process. Around the same time she was trying to renew her visa with the Home Office and was not aware of any problems with the application before she went to see Mee. She said He said there was a delay for me to pay the money that if the visa did not come I can not go for selection and my date was already fixed. He told me he can help me. He told me that because I need to go to selection and my passport was with the Home Office and he told me that he was going to help and I said How are you going to do that He just said A call that I can make and I said Why do not you do it He said You know what you can do that will make me do it. Base Mee was working at an Army careers centre in Croydon south London pictured . The court heard that Mee then told the woman to wait for the boss who was going to conduct her interview. But he returned a short time later told her that he would now be talking to her and took her to the kitchen area jurors were told. Dressed in his Army uniform Mee allegedly spoke to the woman about her selection procedure and the fact her passport was with the Home Office before leaving her waiting alone again. The woman said He came back and sat he started asking me if I was going to have sex with him. Jurors heard that she told Mee no and that she was simply there to see the boss still believing that there were other people in the recruitment office. When he asked her for sex again he allegedly said that no one would ever know and later revealed that there was nobody left in the office. The woman told the court that Mee then jumped and kissed her on the lips before asking her to lift up her skirt and show him her underwear. He then pounced on the woman and began assaulting her before she told him that she could not breathe. I was suffocating because he was on top of me the woman said. And I told him that I was suffocating he got scared a bit and that is when he jumped off me because I wasn t breathing. After the incident Mee drove the woman home telling her not to tell anyone what had happened and said that he was helping her out the court heard. The woman said she kept quiet about what happened because he was a big person in the Army and she did not think anyone would believe her. Jurors heard that soon afterwards the alleged victim received a letter from the Home Office saying her visa had been granted and she thought Mee had been responsible for this. Sergeant Mee denies assaulting the women between 2010 and 2011 . Mee who now lives in Scotland denies 17 counts of sexual assault three rapes and one count of assault by penetration. Jurors also heard that the woman kept a diary in which she wrote entries about her daily life. Writing about the day she was allegedly raped she said Jock also got a message from the Home Office that they are not going to grant me the extension because I was late to pay the money. Jock had to beg for me and he also sent them a letter to appeal on my behalf. I am so thankful to God that Jock helped me out in that. He has always been there for me if they do not agree he said he will marry me. LOL. That is so sweet of him. God please do not let anything happen to me. In cross examination Lisa Wilding QC asked the woman if Mee had offered to marry her jokingly or seriously . That is why I put LOL because that is what I thought because he is telling me all these things that I wasn t aware of she replied. In another entry a few days later she thanked the sergeant for helping her with her application to remain in the UK. She wrote I also thank Jock for making that call to the Home Office. He helped me a lot. If he did not call they should have refused me. Asked why she had not told anyone of the rape the woman explained that she was like an abused child. She said He is just like a father who is abusing a child and the child does not know that you are abusing it and you are torn between love and hate. That is how I felt. The trial continues.

Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11 year olds which assess English maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury pictured to make the changes to their SATs exam answers . The 31 year old also altered a number of the pupil s exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules school officials were tipped off resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school s SAT s results after a probe by the local education authority file picture However he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers but to make them more legible. But the panel run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school that can in no way excuse his behaviour. It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority. Paul Heathcote acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. Mr Guffick’s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. In all the circumstances I agree with the panel’s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction. Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions. He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court.,"a teacher has been banned from the classroom after he let pupils change their exam answers invalidating his whole school s sats results.

For most people Barcelona s progress into the Champions League semi final looks a formality given they beat Paris Saint Germain 3 1 in the first leg in France. The only man bound to disagree is the one who modestly called his autobiography I am Zlatan . Zlatan Ibrahimovic is put through his paces with Blaise Matuidi left and Zoumana Camara at the Nou Camp . Ibrahimovic and his PSG team mates including David Luiz pictured face Barcelona on Tuesday night . The Sweden international was suspended for the first leg after he was dismissed against Chelsea . At 33 Ibrahimovic is past caring what other people think of him. With an ego that makes Louis van Gaal look like a shrinking violet he will walk down the tunnel at the Nou Camp convinced in his own mind that Messi Neymar and Luis Suarez will be in awe of him. When asked to name a dream team of team mates he d played with he named himself up front with Messi – ahead of Thierry Henry and Alessandro del Piero. Football is not something you plan in advance. It just happens he says. His 30 yard propellor kick for Sweden against England is rated by Steven Gerrard as the greatest goal he s ever seen. To be fair Ibrahimovic s CV allows him plenty of bragging rights. The Swede with Bosnian roots has played for Ajax Juventus Barcelona and both Milan giants. He once won eight league titles in a row. Not bad for a poor kid whose immigrant parents moved to the roughest part of Malmo. Now he s trying to make new history with PSG. He was the marquee signing when Qatari owners bought the Paris side and decided to try and turn it into Europe s greatest football club. They agreed to pay him GBP200 000 a week even though France s 75 per cent top tax rate meant their total bill would be close to GBP50million a year. Not that Ibrahimovic is that overly grateful. He recently called France a s**t country and had to apologise in a rare burst of self awareness. Despite domestic dominance Champions League glory has remained elusive so far. Ibrahimovic has never won the trophy as a player and his bad luck in the competition continued when he was harshly sent off in the previous round against Chelsea and was therefore suspended for the first leg against Barca. Ibrahimovic is PSG s main attraction and will take centre stage against his old club Barcelona on Tuesday . The former Barcelona striker jumps for joy after scoirng against Bastia in the French League Cup final . Ibrahimovic pictured celebrating with Marquinhos will be convinced that PSG can progress against Barca . For Paris to pull off one of European football s greatest comebacks Zlatan and Marco Verratti will have to excel. Ibrahimovic undoubtedly has the talent to produce a flash of brilliance or two to put Luis Enrique s men under pressure. His balletic left footed back heel while on the rise for Sweden against Italy at Euro 2004 was a goal very few players could have scored. His famous strike against England silenced those who wondered why he could never produce against British clubs. Against Barcelona Ibra will have special motivation. He spent a season at the Nou Camp in 2009/10. It should have been the perfect stage for his talents but he moved to Inter Milan after just a year. Ibrahimovic spent just one season at the Nou Camp before moving to Serie A giants Inter Milan . He felt Messi s insistence on playing more centrally inhibited his own game and that coach Pep Guardiola wasn t strong enough to devise a system that could incorporate both of them. He called Guardiola a spineless coward after Barcelona were beaten by Jose Mourinho s Inter Milan in the Champions League.

For months she would suffer swelling, feel exhausted, and faint .
Thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus .
Tests suggested she had high levels of mercury due to amalgam fillings .",Jameela spent GBP3 000 on having all her amalgam fillings removed and replaced with white fillings . Jameela Jamil has the dazzling smile that you d expect of a television presenter and former model. Yet the 29 year old broadcaster is convinced her teeth or rather the dental work done on them triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years. From the age of 21 I would wake up in the morning with a puffy swollen face feeling utterly hungover even though I do not drink says Jameela who has presented the Radio 1 Chart Show and programmes for Channel 4. My head felt heavy and I was permanently exhausted. Occasionally I would even faint. There were days when I d arrive at work and the make up artists would send me home because I just looked awful and felt terrible. After several months of this she went to a private doctor who referred her for tests. Jameela thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus an auto immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body. In fact the tests suggested she had high levels of mercury. After other potential causes such as diet were ruled out it was suggested the problem was down to the ten amalgam fillings she d had as a child. So she spent GBP3 000 on having them all removed and replaced with white fillings. Dental amalgam has been used for more than 150 years and every year 12 million fillings made from it are given to patients in Britain. Amalgam remains a standard material to use especially on back teeth because it is particularly robust. It is made from a mixture of metals including silver tin and copper. Liquid mercury is used to help mix these components together. Breathing in extremely high concentrations of mercury can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia and affect the central nervous system causing muscle tremors. Long term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys. But mercury poisoning is very rare suggests Dr Prem Mahendra a consultant haematologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham. In 27 years as a haematologist I have never been asked to test for mercury he says. Dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed the mercury can release vapour. This is absorbed into the bloodstream in the lungs and then taken to the kidneys to be passed out harmlessly in the urine. Blood tests showed she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels her fillings were pinpointed as the cause . But the amounts taken in from fillings is minuscule says Salford dentist Dr Ben Atkins. Indeed a review by the EU Commission s Scientific Committee in 2008 concluded there was no risk from amalgam says Professor Damien Walmsley the British Dental Association s scientific adviser. Amalgam is strong durable and adaptable and there is no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use adds StJohn Crean professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of Central Lancashire. It is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth 5 per cent of the population react to contact with amalgams in this way but this poses no risk to health adds Professor Walmsley. And yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway because of patient concern about the risk. Finland and Japan have restrictions on its use with a view to phasing it out. This follows research linking mercury to certain diseases. A 2012 review of 106 studies published in the Journal of Alzheimer s Disease suggested mercury from amalgams could be a contributing factor to the condition. But fillings are not the only source of mercury. It can get into the blood through food nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces though the Food Standards Agency says this is not a concern for most people. However some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that could harm an unborn baby or young child s developing nervous system. That s why young children and women planning to have a baby or who are already pregnant or breastfeeding are advised to avoid fish that can have higher levels of mercury such as shark swordfish and marlin. Pregnant women are advised to limit their tuna to no more than two steaks or four medium sized cans a week. And yet dental amalgam pictured posed by model is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway because of patient concern about the risk . But Jameela does not eat fish so knew the mercury levels could not be due to her diet. She s allergic to peanuts shellfish and dairy foods and at 12 was diagnosed with coeliac disease a condition which causes an adverse reaction to gluten found in wheat barley and rye. Following blood tests it was discovered that she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels her fillings were pinpointed as the cause. All I could think of was I had to get rid of them says Jameela. But while she expected her symptoms to immediately subside once her fillings were removed they continued to affect her over the next few years. I hated the fatigue the headaches the fact I should have been fit and healthy but felt rotten all the time Jameela says. I read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system. I think that the mercury was affecting my immune and digestive system. Dentist Dr Atkins has spoken to many patients who have wanted to have their silver fillings removed because they are concerned about the potential health issues. But he warns that removing amalgams can do more harm than good as more vapour can be inhaled into the system by doing this. Aside from the fact there is no evidence to suggest amalgams are anything other than safe every time a dentist drills a tooth they remove a little dental tissue. So you are essentially damaging the tooth he says. The number of fillings in the average adult s mouth . Still struggling Jameela saw a nutritionist who recommended drinking solutions made from clay and algae chlorella three times a day. These apparently bind to mercury and help remove it. She did this for two years and tried various diets to tackle the inflammation linked to the mercury that was making her ill. For my 25th birthday my flatmate gave me a piece of melon with a candle in it cake was out of the question she says. It took about a year before I started to feel better. It s all had a massive impact on my life. However Anton Emmanuel consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital London is not convinced mercury could affect digestion in this way. You would have to be exposed to massive overdoses of mercury for the gut to be affected he says. Not in the level or forms that you get with mercury fillings. In fact I see patients whose gut symptoms ironically seem to be caused by the stress and anxiety of thinking that it is their mercury fillings which are causing stomach problems when there is no physical sign of any gut disorders. But Jameela remains convinced that the mercury was the cause of her problems. There is so much we do not know about amalgam fillings. I know I feel much better now she says. Private clinics offer mercury testing. But Dr Mahendra says anyone thinking of having this done should check that the clinic s laboratories have clinical pathology accreditation CPA to ensure that the tests are carried out properly.

He was convicted of rape and four other abuse charges at court last year .
Ambulance worker told women he was gay before assaulting them in bed .
HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee removed him from register .
Panel described crimes against three women as 'a serious breach of trust'",A paramedic who pretended he was gay to get close to women before sexually assaulting them has been struck off the medical register. Christopher Bridger 25 from Stevenage Hertfordshire attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as a serious breach of trust . Christopher Bridger 25 who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women has been struck off the medical register . A jury at Guildford Crown Court Surrey found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George s University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said I just want to like girls. The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a serious breach of trust The women aged in their 20s who cannot be named for legal reasons were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet fearing her partner would not understand what had happened but the day after on his birthday he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry. Another said You do not have to forgive me I am just telling you the truth. I am ashamed of myself. His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life but failed to attend today s medical register hearing. Striking him off chair of the HCPC panel Nicola Bastin said The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court Surrey found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges . The panel takes the view that this case is serious it does indeed involve abuse of trust sexual abuse of a serious nature and furthermore there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant. The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions. When he was sentenced in September Mr Recorder Mark Milliken Smith told him These were wicked mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.,"a paramedic who pretended he was gay to get close to women before sexually assaulting them has been struck off the medical register.

The ""smart bullets"" can help shooters compensate for high winds .
The goal of  the program is to give shooters greater range and make American troops safer .",CNN You know the phrase dodging a bullet Forget about it. Probably not going to happen anymore. The U.S. military said this week it has made great progress in its effort to develop a self steering bullet. In February the smart bullets .50 caliber projectiles equipped with optical sensors passed their most successful round of live fire tests to date according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA. In the tests an experienced marksman repeatedly hit moving and evading targets a DARPA statement said. Additionally the statement said a novice shooter using the system for the first time hit a moving target. In other words now you do not even have to be a good shot to hit the mark. The system has been developed by DARPA s Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance program known as EXACTO. True to DARPA s mission EXACTO has demonstrated what was once thought impossible the continuous guidance of a small caliber bullet to target said Jerome Dunn DARPA program manager. This live fire demonstration from a standard rifle showed that EXACTO is able to hit moving and evading targets with extreme accuracy at sniper ranges unachievable with traditional rounds. Fitting EXACTO s guidance capabilities into a small .50 caliber size is a major breakthrough and opens the door to what could be possible in future guided projectiles across all calibers Dunn said. Videos supplied by DARPA show the bullets making sharp turns in midair as they pursue their targets. It all conjures up images of a cartoon character frantically fleeing a bullet that follows him wherever he goes. Only these bullets are traveling at hundreds of miles per hour. And even the Road Runner can not run that fast. DARPA says the smart bullets will also help shooters who are trying for example to hit targets in high winds. The goals of the EXACTO program are giving shooters accuracy at greater distances engaging targets sooner and enhancing the safety of American troops DARPA said.,"cnn you know the phrase dodging a bullet forget about it.
