Tests conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on how quickly passengers can leave a plane are conducted using planes with a standard pitch of 31 inches, which has decreased on some airlines, such as United Airlines with 30 inches and some airlines with as little as 28 inches.

The U.S. Department of Transportation's consumer advisory group highlighted that, unlike for animals, there is no minimum space requirement for humans on planes. This lack of regulation is criticized, especially when some airlines have reduced the seat pitch—the distance between seats—to less than the 31 inches used in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) safety tests.

The length of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever figures show . This was 14 per cent down on a decade earlier when listeners clocked up an average of 11.6 hours a week. The minutes of the BBC Trust’s February meeting published yesterday revealed that director general Tony Hall highlighted the fall. ‘He noted...that time spent listening to BBC radio had dropped to its lowest ever level ’ the documents said. Sources blamed the downward trend on people leading faster paced lives than in the past and a change in habits amongst young people. Lord Tony Hall BBC director general highlighted the decline to the BBC Trust according to minutes of its February meeting . Many people who used to listen to radio as a daily habit now turn to online streaming services such as Spotify for their music fix. That problem is likely to grow as Apple develops its long rumoured streaming service. A BBC spokesman said ‘The number of people listening to BBC radio stations and audience appreciation levels are as high as ever. ‘But time spent listening has inevitably been affected by digital competition and as people ‘tune in’ in new digital ways. ‘ Those ways aren’t reflected in the traditional listening figures quoted here – like watching videos from radio shows or listening to podcasts.’ BBC radio is still reaching 65 per cent of the population each week according to the last set of figures available from RAJAR the organisation which measures radio audiences. But although that figure feels relatively healthy by today’s standards it has none the less fallen by more over the last decade. In the final three months of 2004 66 per cent of people in Britain listened to BBC network radio every week. Lord Hall also used the BBC Trust meeting to note the strong performance of BBC Radio 6 the digital music station which the Corporation had at one point been planning to scrap. ‘He reported that the recent RAJAR figures showed that 6Music had become the first digital only station to reach two million listeners ’ the minutes said. Earlier this month Matthew Postgate the BBC’s chief technology officer said the Corporation would adopt a new ‘digital first’ strategy to help it target a new generation of users. He said the organisation needed to ‘learn lessons’ if they want to ‘compete with organisations that were born in the digital age’.,"The amount of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever the corporation’s boss has admitted.

In every other respect however 29 year old Evans a single mum from Dudley was a winner on Thursday night. She advanced the cause of women in sport no end and gave Doherty the fright of his life in an enthralling and attritional match that will not be bettered in this year s qualifying tournament. Snooker s governing body had been criticised in some quarters for allowing Evans a wild card to compete alongside 127 male players for the right to play in the sport s blue chip event on April 18 something no female had achieved. Reanne Evans shakes hands with Ken Doherty following his 10 8 victory at Ponds Forge . Evans plays a shot during her world championship qualifying match against Doherty . Doherty who won the World Championship title back in 1997 took out the first frame 71 15 . Evans had Doherty in all sorts of trouble before the former champion closed out the game 10 8 . Those critics and the bookies who made Doherty a ridiculously short priced 20/1 on favourite were made to look foolish as Evans had her illustrious opponent on the ropes before finally bowing out 10 8. A gracious Doherty admitted afterwards She played out of her skin. It was good match play snooker and tough all the way through. There was a lot of pressure on this match a different kind of pressure to what I have ever experienced. I do not usually feel sympathy for my opponents but I felt sorry at the end. She played better than me and lost. I do not know how I won that final frame. If it had gone to 9 9 I d have been a million to one to win it. Evans cheered on by her eight year old daughter Lauren at the Ponds Forge sports centre in Sheffield admitted she was exhausted after a match of unfamiliar intensity for her. A 10 time ladies champion Evans had led twice during the opening session before Doherty went 5 4 in front . The 10 time ladies world champion collected just GBP400 as prize money for winning the title in 2013 and this was a completely different environment against a player who beat Stephen Hendry to be crowned the best player in the world in 1997. It was a struggle. With the experience Ken had I just had to dig in she said. Ken had little runs when he needed it but I could tell he was under pressure. Some of the balls were wobbling in from the first frame. I just could not take advantage in the end. I can play better than I did so there is no reason I can not return and beat Ken or even players above him. I have the women s game on my shoulders. I just hope I get some help and am allowed to play in more big tournaments to give me experience. Next week I will playing the ladies in the club again. It s a lovely club do not get me wrong but I do not think many ladies could give Ken a game. I think I would have won if I d taken it to 9 9. The presence of television crews and snooker star Ronnie O Sullivan underlined what a big story Evans participation was. Evans eyes up her move during an enthralling game with Doherty in Sheffield . She lost the first frame convincingly but the nerves did not show after that. She reeled off three frames in a row led 4 3 and once Doherty went in front pegged him back to 5 5 and 6 6. The Irishman now ranked No 46 in the world started to look his 45 years. He sat down at every opportunity while Evans often stood while he played. She had the confidence to play right handed or left handed as O Sullivan sometimes does. The key frame was the sixteenth. It lasted 45 minutes with Evans rattling off the first 59 points and Doherty the next 74. It took Doherty to a 9 7 lead but Evans came roaring back in the next frame. He needed a snooker to avoid the match going into a final frame – and he got it. Doherty now ranked No 46 in the world showed his experience to close out the contest . He has two more qualifying rounds before he makes the Crucible but it s doubtful he will face a tougher opponent. They should let her play in more competitions he added. Evans should certainly use this match to become a leading ambassador for women s sport.

Peter Bergen: U.S. should rethink hostage policy to increase chances of freeing those held .",CNN Warren Weinstein who appears to have been the only American citizen held hostage by al Qaeda was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike in January. But it did not have to be that way. A senior U.S. official familiar with the handling of the issue told CNN that the U.S. government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73 year old development expert s release either directly to al Qaeda or through proxies in Pakistan. Another senior U.S. official told CNN that Weinstein s capture by al Qaeda made it hard for the United States to negotiate even though proxies such as the Pakistani government have links to intermediaries who might have helped. A senior Pakistani official told CNN that after Weinstein was kidnapped the Pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant Haqqani Network and to the Pakistani Taliban which are both allied to al Qaeda to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about Weinstein. According to the official nothing came of those feelers. The senior Pakistani official says that during the past year Pakistani soldiers who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of North Waziristan near the Afghan Pakistan border where Weinstein was believed to be being held went door to door looking for the American. Nothing came of this search either. On Thursday the U.S. government announced that Weinstein had been killed in a counterterrorism operation in January which is how the government often describes CIA drone strikes. According to New America which tracks drone strikes in Pakistan CIA drone attacks happened in Shawal North Waziristan on January 19 in which at least four militants were killed also on January 15 in Tehsil Ladha South Waziristan in which at least five militants were killed and on January 4 in Datta Khel South Waziristan in which at least eight militants were killed. It is in one of these strikes that Weinstein was almost certainly killed. Lt. Col. Jason Amerine a planner on the U.S. Army staff is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter s office which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of American hostages held by al Qaeda and the Taliban. A plan was developed in the Pentagon to secure the release of Weinstein according to a staff member on Hunter s committee. That plan was to release Haji Bashir Noorzai a prominent and influential member of the Taliban who is in prison in the States on drug trafficking charges in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Berghdal who was held by the Taliban until last year Taliban hostages Caitlin Coleman a U.S. citizen and her husband Canadian Joshua Boyle and Dr. Shakil Afridi who spied for the CIA in Pakistan and was being held in a Pakistani prison as well as Weinstein. It s not clear how far this plan of action went. Amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure. Hunter a California Republican released a statement Thursday saying The only government organization seriously developing options to recover Weinstein and others in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region was within the Pentagon led by war hero Jason Amerine. As an Army captain Amerine led a small detachment of U.S. Special Forces into Afghanistan in November 2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States. The operation was instrumental in helping to topple the Taliban and to install Hamid Karzai as the new leader of Afghanistan. Who exactly carried out Weinstein s kidnapping from his house 31⁄2 years ago in the Pakistani megacity of Lahore has until now not been clear. A senior Pakistani counterterrorism official told CNN that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan or IMU kidnapped Weinstein at his Lahore home on August 13 2011. IMU is an Uzbek terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan. According to the Pakistani official the leader of the Weinstein kidnapping cell was a relative of Tahir Yuldashev the former IMU leader killed in a CIA drone strike in the Pakistani tribal regions in 2009. The initial lead that traced the Weinstein kidnapping to the IMU came from another high profile kidnapping in Pakistan two weeks after Weinstein s abduction. Shahbaz Taseer the son of a leading Pakistani liberal politician Salman Taseer who was killed by Pakistani militants eight months earlier was kidnapped in Lahore on August 26 2011. At the scene of Taseer s kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and SIM card that eventually led Pakistani officials to focus on the IMU group in Lahore according to the senior Pakistani counterterrorism official. The police subsequently arrested three Uzbeks and four Pakistanis who were part of the IMU cell that had carried out the Weinstein kidnapping. Members of the IMU cell told Pakistani interrogators that after they had kidnapped Weinstein they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi conscious among three safe houses in Lahore. IMU members then took Weinstein to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan a semi autonomous region along the border with Afghanistan where al Qaeda and other militant groups are headquartered. There Weinstein was given or more likely sold to al Qaeda according to the senior Pakistani official. Who was Warren Weinstein Weinstein had spent his life helping others working in the fields of aid and development. He held a doctorate in international law and economics from Columbia University and spoke more than half a dozen languages. After his capture the leader of al Qaeda Ayman al Zawahiri demanded the end of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and the release of terrorists held in U.S. custody in exchange for Weinstein s freedom. On September 12 2012 Weinstein appeared in a video produced by al Qaeda s production arm in which he said that the Obama administration had shown no interest in my case. He then appealed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from one Jew to another to intervene. The Obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by ISIS al Qaeda or the Taliban. The key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the U.S. government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them. The CIA for instance is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations while the FBI has responsibility for retrieving American hostages. Often these goals are not in alignment as was clearly the case with Weinstein. The CIA could have exercised more due diligence knowing that Weinstein was almost certainly being held in North Waziristan. There are some solutions for these problems. First families should be granted security clearances by the U.S. government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones. Right now the U.S. government will not communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives do not have the requisite security clearances. Should families abuse their clearances they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones which is a strong incentive not to abuse them. Second President Barack Obama should appoint a senior level person perhaps working in the White House on the National Security Council to oversee the work of the CIA FBI State Department and the Joint Special Operations Command which implements hostage rescues. All these organizations have key roles to play in getting American hostages home. That person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and de conflict any potential issues such as the ones that surfaced in the Weinstein case. Third while the U.S. government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups there is nothing in American policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of U.S. citizens and this should be encouraged even if there is some quid pro quo involved. This is what happened in the case of the American journalist Peter Theo Curtis who was captured by al Qaeda s affiliate in Syria in 2012 but was released last year after the Qatari government intervened in his case. The Qataris have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in Syria including the al Qaeda affiliate holding Curtis and while Qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free Curtis it s unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of al Qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys. Curtis successful release could provide a ray of hope for U.S. citizen Caitlin Coleman and her husband Canadian Joshua Boyle who were captured by the Taliban in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through Afghanistan. A senior American official told CNN they are being held by the Haqqani Network. The Pakistani government has contacts with the Haqqani Network and the U.S. government should ratchet up the pressure on the Pakistani government to secure the couple s release. In captivity Coleman who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage had a child. The name of the child is unknown.,"CNN Warren Weinstein who appears to have been the only American citizen held hostage by al Qaeda was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike in January.

The next time we met she came to my place and said she d like to drink her own alcohol and poured me one too. I then began to fill ill and passed out. When I woke up my feet and hands were tied and there were two men in my flat taking my TV stereo and other things. After carrying out the ruse Davila went to the police station herself to report the robbery claiming she had been forced to leave the flat by the men and had been powerless to stop them. The thief has been nicknamed the Black Widow of Facebook . She is now awaiting trial after admitting tricking 15 men and robbing them. Two of her accomplices will also appear in court over the crimes . But a spokesman for the police said they were suspicious having received numerous calls from men who had been stolen from after they spent the night with a woman they met over the internet . He said The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. This was the first time the woman had actually shown up herself though but because she matched the description we already had we decided to hold her for questioning. One of Davila s victims said the pair hit it off at a hotel and he did not think have any suspicions when they met up again at his home. He said she drugged him and he woke up with his feet tied and two men stealing his TV . As soon as we spoke to the victim we knew she was the woman behind the robberies and it only took a little while before we had a full confession. We also found that the man had been drugged. Davila admitted to bedding and robbing more than 15 men and is now awaiting trial along with her two accomplices.

Lowes Industrie Best & Less and the Just Group which includes Just Jeans Portmans and Dotti were identified as some of the worst performing companies by The 2015 Australian Fashion Report. Amongst the best performers were Etiko Audrey Blue Cotton On H&M and Zara. The report assessed the labour rights management systems of 59 companies and 219 brands operating in Australia. The 2015 Australian Fashion Report has named and shamed some of the worst Aussie clothing brands and companies for their ongoing exploitation of overseas workers . Amongst the best performers were Etiko Audrey Blue Cotton On H&M and Zara . It found that only two of the companies could prove they were paying a full living wage to the workers in two of the three production stages of their clothing. None of the 59 companies could prove the workers at their raw material suppliers were paid a living wage. Unlike a country s legally set minimum wage a living wage ensures that an employee has enough money to cover the necessities like food water electricity and shelter and still has a little left over for themselves and their dependants. In some countries like Bangladesh where the minimum wage is as little as USUSD68 a month and a living wage is USUSD104 the difference can be made by paying each worker just an additional 30c per t shirt. Lowes Industrie Best & Less and the Just Group which includes Just Jeans Portmans and Dotti were identified as some of the worst performers . The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies do not have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can not be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain Gershon Nimbalker an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid said . A mere 12 per cent of companies could demonstrate any action towards paying wages above the legal minimum and even then only for part of their supply chain the report states. Furthermore 91 per cent of companies still do not know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent do not know the source of all their fabrics and inputs. If companies do not know how and where their products are made then there s no way for them to ensure that their workers are protected. Uzbekistan for instance the world s fifth largest exporter of cotton was notorious for its child labour policies which saw children as young as 10 forced to work in the fields until the government recently improved conditions by renouncing the use of child labour on a systematic basis . Furthermore 91 per cent of companies still do not know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent do not know the source of all their fabrics and inputs the report stated . Gershon Nimbalker an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid told Daily Mail Australia that part of the motivation behind the report was to shed light on how many of the world s 165 million children involved in child labour were employed by the fashion industry. The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies do not have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can not be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain he said. There were 61 assessment criteria that we used to grade the companies that were put together with lots of collaboration with international labour rights organisations. We found all the public information available on the companies public statements anything online and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed.

We found all the public information available on the companies public statements anything online and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. The worst grades basically mean that they have very little public information available about what they are doing to protect workers and on top of that that they have not engaged with our research process. About 75 per cent did engage but one quarter did not. However the report also noted some progress in the industry with companies like Kmart and Cotton On improving their transparency by identifying their suppliers and H&M Zara Country Road and the Sussan Group showing attempts to improve their international worker s pay.,"As Australian Fashion Week comes to a close a new damning report has named and shamed some of the worst clothing brands sold in Australia and their companies for the ongoing exploitation of their overseas workers.

The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan s eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city s skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber colored haze was originating from Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14 it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region according to CNN affiliate KOMO TV. As a result the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens blues yellows and purples KOMO TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person s eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.,"CNN A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday.

The partly excavated skeleton was at first suspected to be a large horse or cattle said Alfred Galik a researcher at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna.

They probably did not know what to feed it or whether one could eat it Galik said. While Roman era camel bones occasionally surface in Austria Serbia and Belgium the Tulln discovery was the first complete camel skeleton to emerge in Central Europe.

Dean Obeidallah says the actor and the show were right to leave the detail out .",CNN Would you want a TV program about your family history to include details of a distant long deceased relative who had owned slaves Seriously who in their right mind would want to be tarnished by the sins of an ancestor you had no connection to other than a remote bloodline I would not and neither did Ben Affleck who lobbied producers of a PBS show Finding Your Roots to remove any reference to his great great great grandfather Benjamin Cole a Georgia slave owner in the mid 1800 s in an episode that looked at Affleck s family history. Affleck revealed Cole s name Wednesday night. Here s the thing that might surprise many given the tendency of the media to exploit any potentially scandalous material The show s producer Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. apparently acquiesced to Affleck s request because when the episode aired in October 2014 there was no mention of the star s slave owning ancestor. Affleck s attempt to alter the content of the program only publicly became known a few days ago after WikiLeaks released hacked emails revealing an exchange between Gates and Sony Pictures chief Michael Lynton. When Gates asked how he should respond to Affleck s request to delete the material Lynton responded all things being equal I would definitely take it out. And on Tuesday Affleck via Facebook admitted that he had urged Gates to excise any reference to his slave owning relative. Affleck explained I did not want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth. Now Gates has publicly denied that he made his decision about the content of the program based on Affleck s request but it seems likely that he did. After all Affleck noted as much in his Facebook post writing that Gates agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices I disagreed with. And three other celebrities profiled on the series last season were shown to have been related to slave owners. So it s unlikely that it was simply happenstance that it left out any reference to Affleck s familial slave ownership connection. In any event PBS has launched an internal review to determine if the show violated its own editorial standards. Whatever the results of the review Affleck and Gates did the right thing. Let us be clear Finding Your Roots is not an investigative news show it s an entertainment program. In fact as Affleck noted much of the material is provided directly by the celebrity being profiled. It s not 60 Minutes but more in the nature of a sophisticated profile of celebrities using their marquee names to attract viewers. There s not even a hint that Affleck strong armed the producers or made any type of threats against them if they included the information. In the emails between Gates and Lynton which they presumably believed at the time were confidential and would remain so there was no mention of undue pressure by Affleck. Instead Gates simply noted that Affleck asked us to edit out something. After the emails were revealed Gates issued a statement saying Ultimately I maintain editorial control on all of my projects and with my producers decide what will make for the most compelling program. In the case of Mr. Affleck we focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry including a Revolutionary War ancestor a third great grandfather who was an occult enthusiast and his mother who marched for civil rights during the Freedom Summer of 1964. My view would be different if Affleck had a history of uttering racist remarks or engaging in racist conduct. That would have made the information truly newsworthy. But instead we have a man known for championing progressive causes which I am sure made him even more acutely sensitive that some on the right might possibly use this information against him in the future. Perhaps that s what Affleck meant in his Facebook post when he wrote that this information made him feel vulnerable. Affleck has noted that he regrets asking PBS to not include information about his distant relative. That s a nice gesture but it was not needed. Affleck had every right to ask for the information about a long deceased distant relative to be left out of the show. And PBS had the choice to include it or leave it out. I applaud PBS for doing the right thing at a time when media outlets rarely show any restraint on the lives of people in the public eye.,"CNN Would you want a TV program about your family history to include details of a distant long deceased relative who had owned slaves Seriously who in their right mind would want to be tarnished by the sins of an ancestor you had no connection to other than a remote bloodline I would not and neither did Ben Affleck who lobbied producers of a PBS show Finding Your Roots to remove any reference to his great great great grandfather Benjamin Cole a Georgia slave owner in the mid 1800 s in an episode that looked at Affleck s family history.

Beginning in 2010 the department gave conservative groups with words like patriots or tea party in their names extra scrutiny slow walking their applications and keping many in limbo for years. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had subpoenaed Lerner after she refused to testify voluntarily about her role in the scandal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE DOJ S LETTER TO BOEHNER . I will TELL THE TRUTH ... UNLESS I am TAKING THE FIFTH Former IRS official Lois Lerner insisted on her innocence in an opening statement during a 2013 congressional hearing and then refused to answer lawmakers questions – a choice that the Obama administration now says was perfectly legal . U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen left dropped his bomb on Congress just one day before leaving office to return to private legal practice . Emailed Machen s letter was addressed to House Speaker John Boehner left who was in Jerusalem visiting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu right When she refused again to answer questions during a second hearing on March 5 2014 House Republicans prepared a criminal contempt citation and referred the case to the Justice Department once it was approved. California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa then the Oversight committee s chairman told Lerner in one hearing that she had effectively waived your rights by defending herself under oath. I have not done anything wrong Lerner had said in the 2013 hearing. I have not broken any laws I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee. Machen told Boehner on Tuesday that since Lerner had only made general claims of innocence she was within her rights to refuse to answer questions. Ms. Lemer s general denials of wrongdoing did not amount to testimony about the actual facts under the Committee s review he said. The Fiflh Amendment to the Constitution would provide Ms. Lerner with an absolute defense should she be prosecuted for her refusal to testify. Machen s March 31 letter arrived on Capitol Hill just a day before his resignation took effect after a five year stint as Washington D.C. s top federal prosecutor inside the Justice Department. President Barack Obama named him to his post in December 2009. Reactions swept through the nation s capital as word spread that Lerner was legally in the clear. Once again the Obama administration has tried to sweep IRS targeting of taxpayers for their political beliefs under the rug Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told Daily Mail Online. But unaccountable federal bureaucrats using their power to attack the First Amendment strikes at the heart of our democracy and the American people deserve the truth. The White House said Steel still has the opportunity to do the right thing and appoint a special counsel to examine the IRS’ actions. Attorney General Eric Holder has refused repeatedly to bring in a special counsel instead appointing attorney Barbara Bosserman to lead an internal probe. Republicans see Bosserman as a politically conflicted choice Federal Election Commission records show that she donated a total of USD6 750 to Obama’s campaigns and to the Democratic National Committee. SWITCH During the tea party targeting hearings it was Oversight committee ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings left who was regularly exasperated – but now Darrell Issa right his Republican foil at the time is frustrated by a lack of accountability for Lerner . Tea party groups and other conservative organizations seeking tax exempt status were kept in limbo for years while the IRS often green lighted liberal groups in weeks or months . Issa whose outrage led to the congressional contempt citation against Lerner – and one against Holder for refusing to turn over documents related to the scandal – was livid. Refusing to prosecute Mrs. Lerner and Mr. Holder after they were held in contempt by a vote of the House of Representatives sends a disturbing message that it is permissible for senior government officials to lie to Congress and to ignore subpoenas for information vital to Congressional investigations he said Wednesday in a statement. Issa s successor as chairman of the Oversight committee Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz said Machen s letter exhibits a disregard for the rule of law and scoffed at his objectivity. It is unclear whether the Administration directed Mr. Machen not to prosecute Lois Lerner or whether he was motivated by an ideological kinship with IRS’s leadership Chaffetz said. The Committee will continue to pursue its ongoing investigation into the targeting of American citizens based on their political beliefs. Our goal is to ensure that the people responsible including Lois Lerner are held accountable. Lerner s attorney William Taylor said in a statement that his client looks forward to moving on with her life. It is unfortunate that the majority party in the House put politics before a citizen s constitutional rights Taylor said.

Brett McGurk: Iraqi leader making progress with Sunni tribes in planned Anbar offensive .",Washington CNN ISIS is a problem that is off the charts historically and has sent the United States into uncharted territory when it comes to putting down the terror group the Obama administration s point man in the fight recently told CNN. The comments which Brett McGurk made in an exclusive interview were some of the administration s strongest to date in describing the challenge the United States and its allies face in battling ISIS. This is a problem that is off the charts historically he said referring to the more than 20 000 foreign fighters who have gone into Syria. Just put that into perspective It s about twice the number that went into Afghanistan in the 1980s over a 10 year period to fight the Soviet Union and those came really from only a handful of countries. He concluded We are in unchartered territory here. McGurk just returned from an urgent summit of coalition nations held in Jordan. Last week Canada became the latest nation to conduct airstrikes against ISIS over Syria. The United States now lists 62 countries in the coalition. As the U.S. led coalition has focused attention on Iraq and Syria ISIS has expanded its reach to Libya Egypt and Yemen often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants. McGurk did not rule out expanding U.S. military action beyond Iraq and Syria to combat the increasing regional threat. We have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests some of which are military tools he said. Of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do. The United States has also been stepping up efforts to involve Sunni groups in the fight against ISIS. To date that involvement has been extremely limited as Sunni tribes see Shiite militias many with horrendous human rights records take the lead. But McGurk said that Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al Abadi is making progress getting Sunni tribes to support a planned Iraqi offensive against ISIS in Anbar province in the coming weeks. He stressed the importance of working with al Abadi noting that the Iraqi leader was in Anbar province last week handing out more than 1 000 AK 47s to tribal fighters who are going to join the Iraqi security forces. We are helping to enable and train them as they begin to go on the offensive over the coming weeks and months in Anbar McGurk said. They put out this very perverse twisted vision and it s very attractive to a lot of young men around the world he acknowledged. But in fact what the foreign fighters are finding in Syria and Iraq is that they are more likely to get killed in Iraq and Syria and in fact instead of getting a slave bride as ISIS leaders promise them they are more likely to get killed by a female Peshmerga fighter in the streets of Kobani. That bottom line he assessed could turn the tide The foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it s like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate and I think we are going to see those networks begin to dry up.,"Washington CNN ISIS is a problem that is off the charts historically and has sent the United States into uncharted territory when it comes to putting down the terror group the Obama administration s point man in the fight recently told CNN.

Villegas holed out on the fourth and eighth as he finished alongside Kevin Streelman on five under par only to find water on the eighth when he played it again as the third play off hole. Kevin Streelman holds his trophy aloft after winning the Par 3 Contest on a play off against Camilo Villegas . Streelman therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the curse of the par three champion with no player ever becoming par three and Masters champion in the same year. However that was placed firmly into perspective thanks to his 11 year old caddie Ethan Couch who has a benign but inoperable brain tumour. Streelman found Couch via the Make a Wish Foundation and invited him to be his caddie in the light hearted curtain raiser. Augusta National s par three course traditionally hosts the contest the day before start of the major . It was a really fun day especially to have Ethan with me here Streelman said. This is not about me today. It s about helping him out and showing him a great day. Villegas said I have made a few hole in ones but it s pretty special to make them here. The second one we were a little more emotional there. We just kind of jumped. Nicklaus had earlier holed out with an eight iron from 123 yards on the fourth his ball landing around 15 feet past the pin and spinning back into the hole. Woods played in the Masters par three contest at Augusta National for the first time in 11 years . That took the 75 year old six time champion to three under par but he would bogey the fifth and hit two balls into the water on the ninth to end his hopes of an unlikely triumph. Former US Open champion Curtis Strange reminded Nicklaus of the tradition that players who make a hole in one have to buy the drinks in the clubhouse when Nicklaus walked past the ESPN commentary position. Send me a bill Nicklaus replied. The Masters official Twitter account shared an image of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods with Niall Horan . The 18 time major winner added on ESPN I never had a hole in one at Augusta in the par three contest or on the golf course. Doing an interview this morning I said all I have to do is go out there make a hole in one and win the par three. I had it three under and then choked. Since the contest started in 1960 nobody has ever become par three and Masters champion in the same week a fact which sometimes sees players deliberately not shoot the best score possible. Most treat it as light relief and invite family or friends to act as their caddies including Tiger Woods this year for the first time since 2004. Woods had his children Charlie and Sam on his bag and made sure he could not win the event by getting daughter Sam to tap in for par on the sixth. Jack Nicklaus centre with Ben Crenshaw left and Gary Player right during the Par 3 Contest . We had an absolutely great time. These were memories for a lifetime said Woods who was also accompanied by girlfriend Lindsey Vonn. He later added on Twitter I will always have memories of my pop at Augusta and now Sam & Charlie. An amazing day. Tournament favourite Rory McIlroy had One Direction singer Niall Horan acting as his caddie and Horan proved he should stick to singing after badly hooking a tee shot on the ninth into the water. I apologise to golf Horan joked. I do perform to a lot of people but we were performing to their parents today! There was a lot of pressure. McIlroy who is looking to become the sixth player to complete the career grand slam by winning a first Masters title on Sunday added I wanted to do this because it s a big week for me and just to go into the tournament in a relaxed mood.

It is the first time that Labour leader has been ahead in approval ratings .
Labour Party has also taken a commanding four point lead over the Tories .",Ed Miliband has overtaken David Cameron as the most popular political leader for the first time. In a shock new poll that will send shockwaves through Downing Street the Labour leader has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings. The Labour Party has also taken a commanding four point lead over the Tories with just 28 days until polling day according to the pollsters Survation. Labour leader Ed Miliband has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings a Survation poll has revealed . The revelation comes in the wake of a furious political row over the Labour leader’s personal character – after the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mr Miliband could stab Britain in the back like he did to his brother. Mr Miliband responded by accusing the Tories of dragging the election campaign ‘into the gutter’. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader. But the campaign could backfire if Mr Miliband overtakes the Prime Minister in the polls. According to tonight’s Survation poll for the Daily Mirror with less than a month until the general election Labour has opened up a four point gap over the Tories. Labour is up 2 points on 35 the Conservatives down one to 31. Nigel Farage’s Ukip meanwhile are down three to 15 with the Lib Dems still struggling on just 9 per cent. The SNP and the Greens are on 4 per cent each. It is the biggest Labour lead in a Survation poll since February and was conducted after the party announced plans to scrap a ‘tax loophole’ used by wealthy ‘non doms’ to lower their tax bills. With less than a month until the general election Labour has opened up a four point gap over the Tories. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader . According to tonight’s poll nearly seven out of ten voters back Mr Miliband’s proposal to scrap the non dom tax status. Four out of 10 voters ‘strongly’ support the move – with just 14 per cent opposed. The poll surveyed 1 111 people on Wednesday and Thursday. Miliband announced on Wednesday that he wanted to scrap tax rules that allow wealthy individuals to legally reduce the amount of tax they pay on money earned overseas. The Survation poll found 59 percent of respondents supported the idea. A separate poll by Yougov for The Sun newspaper on Wednesday gave Labour a one percentage point lead over the Conservatives.,"Ed Miliband has overtaken David Cameron as the most popular political leader for the first time.

The poll surveyed over 1,000 people and found that Miliband's lead came after his announcement that he would be scrapping a tax loophole for wealthy ""non doms"". This announcement was met with strong support from voters, with nearly seven out of ten supporting the proposal and four out of ten ""strongly"" supporting it, compared to just 14% opposition.

This development, marked by Miliband's leap in personal approval ratings, emerges amidst intense political debate, notably following Defence Secretary Michael Fallon's criticism of Miliband's character. Miliband accused the Tories of lowering the campaign's tone in response. The poll, revealing a 35% support for Labour against the Tories' 31%, suggests public backing for Miliband's proposal to abolish the non-dom tax loophole, with nearly 70% of voters in favor.

Our engineers have restored power to 2 000 customers and the remaining 1 100 will regain power through generators and cable works as soon as possible. We had over a hundred staff working through the night and work continues today. We are working with the emergency services and other agencies to keep affected customers updated. The cause of the incident is being investigated. Fire crews last night doused the hole with water before they smashed the cover open with a sledgehammer and continued to pump in water from multiple hoses. Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said that the fact the fire started in an underground tunnel meant it had been tricky to bring it under control. This has been a technically difficult incident to tackle he said. The reason that the fire is still burning is because the service tunnel is hard to reach and although firefighters have been applying water through access points throughout the night the complexity of the tunnel layout means that it will be some time until the fire is fully extinguished.

It was Albert Adomah s turn to have a pop three minutes later when he shot from just inside the area but Martinez did well to get down to it and he was also denied by Danny Lafferty on the line minutes later. The opening goal came five minutes into the second half when Tomlin pressed forward and the Millers defenders stood off the forward allowing him time and space to plant a low shot past Martinez. The United keeper had to be on his toes again five minutes after the goal when Kike played a smart ball in behind the defence for Bamford but Martinez did well to smother the ball at his feet. Kike had a shot saved on the hour before Bamford doubled Boro s lead six minutes later with his 16th goal of the season. Tomlin laid the ball off for the Chelsea forward and he took one touch before coolly rolling the ball past Martinez into the bottom corner.

And from the resulting corner Kike met Adam Forshaw s ball with a thumping header which Martinez had to tip over the bar.

It ll be exciting whatever. There is mounting speculation the men are working on a new motoring series to be aired by Netflix Amazon or another British broadcaster. Producer Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries.

Lineham scored a treble in a losing cause at Castleford last month but his efforts on Friday night settled a drab contest at the KC Stadium. The 22 year old winger showed good opportunism and no little speed on two occasions to pluck passes out of the air and race over 90 metres to add to his early opener. The hat trick puts him out in front as Super League s most prolific finisher in 2015. Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye catching hat trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22 8 . Jamie Shaul went over late on to make sure of the two competition points for Hull with tries from Kevin Brown and Patrick Ah Van unable to prevent Widnes from falling to a fifth away defeat out of five. It was a third match in nine days for both sides although Widnes had reason to feel more hard done by after their Easter Monday trip to Catalans. Ah Van had an early opportunity to give the Vikings an extra spring in their step but a foot in touch saw his effort ruled out although Rhys Hanbury s pass was forward in any case. There was no doubt when Lineham slid over in the corner at the other end after Shaul had spun out of a tackle and found his winger with a nice cut out pass. The Vikings were defending doggedly near their own line to prevent a second Hull try when Stefan Marsh and Chris Dean were both forced off following a sickening clash of heads. Lineham had a good chance to lay the platform for another Hull raid following a break down the right but his pass was intercepted by former Black and Whites hooker Aaron Heremaia. Widnes worked their way downfield and were back level when Brown whose high kick in the build up appeared to have gone forward off Ah Van forced the ball down from dummy half. The Vikings lost a third player as Lloyd White hobbled off but they thought they had edged in front when Joe Mellor touched down his own dab through only for the video referee to correctly rule a knock on. What might have been a half time lead turned into a six point deficit as Lineham intercepted Brown s pass and raced 95 metres for a try which took him level with Castleford s Justin Carney on nine for the season. And he was out on his own as leading try scorer when he repeated the trick just after the break Hanbury the victim on this occasion as he tried to find Ah Van 10 metres from the Hull line. Lineham almost turned provider on the hour mark but his wild pass could not be taken in by Shaul. Jordan Rankin was then wide with a 40 metre penalty attempt after play had been brought back for a shoulder charge by Eamon O Carroll. But Hull did not have to wait too much longer for their next points as Rankin s grubber kick hit a post and sat up perfectly for Shaul to slide over. Widnes who saw Gil Dudson held up over the line earlier in the half gave themselves some hope when Ah Van finished spectacularly in the corner but it proved no more than a consolation.,"Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye catching hat trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22 8 to make it back to back wins for the first time since last June.

Both federal government regulations and the American Heart Association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year. As the federal government prepares its influential Dietary Guidelines for 2015 some scientists are now saying that the average American salt consumption rate carries no risk. The guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2 300 milligrams with an even stricter 1 500 milligram limit for African Americans and people over 50. In February the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended keeping the larger limit although it withdrew support for the stricter limit for African Americans and people over 50 reports The Washington Post. There is no longer any valid basis for the current salt guidelines said Andrew Mente a professor at McMaster University in Ontario and one of the researchers involved in a major study published last year by the New England Journal of Medicine. So why are we still scaring people about salt While experts on both sides agree that eating too much salt especially for people with high blood pressure can be dangerous there is much disagreement over what constitutes too much. The average American ingests about 3 500 milligrams of salt per day the amount of sodium in a teaspoon of salt and so under the current dietary guidelines Americans are indeed endangering themselves. Even within the American Heart Association one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits there is disagreement with at least one former president claiming that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure . Salt skeptics however believe most Americans are fine. In their view a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6 000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks. The skeptics also warn of the dangers of consuming too little they say that below 3 000 milligrams also raises health risks. The PURE study published last August by the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who conform to the recommended limits 2 300 milligrams actually have more heart trouble. They found that low sodium may stimulate the production of renin a hormone that may have harmful effects on blood vessels. Even within the American Heart Association one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits there is disagreement. The totality of the evidence strongly suggests that Americans should be lowering their sodium intake said Elliott Antman the president of the American Heart Association. Everyone agrees that current sodium intake is too high. But Suzanne Oparil a former president of the American Heart Association told the Post that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure.

Admitted Charles had sent him a lot of letters while he was in government .
Released two, including one condolence letter over death of his mother .
Comes after court ruled Charles's letters to ministers should be published .",Labour peer John Prescott has defended Prince Charles over allegations he tries to secretly influence government policy with scrawled private notes to ministers insisting he should right to write as many damn letters as he likes . The former deputy prime minister said he cannot see a problem with the future King writing to government ministers and insisted he had a lot to offer this country . Lord Prescott s intervention comes after the Supreme Court backed a previous ruling paving the way for the publication of Prince Charles s so called black spider memos. Lord Prescott left said that the Prince of Wales has a lot to offer the country . The letters were penned between September 2004 and March 2005 and sent by the Prince to seven government departments. Lord Prescott whose letters are separate to those due to be released said that while he is not a raving loyalist he has a lot of time for Charles who he described as a passionate environmentalist. He said while he listens to the views of everyone who contacts him on political matters he makes his own decisions. The former Labour minister writing in the Sunday Mirror said Charles has an awful lot to offer this country. And if he wants to serve his subjects by helping young people into work combating climate change and building sustainable communities he can write as many damn letters as he likes. Lord Prescott published extracts from two letters he received from the Prince including one expressing his sadness at the death of the Labour politician s mother. The Labour peer said the notes proved the measure of the man . He said They show he has nothing to hide and he should not be worried about publication. The first letter is a typed ­invitation to a meeting of Regional­ ­Development Agency leaders in 1999. Charles says it would be splendid to see Lord Prescott. The second is more personal and was written in the Prince s ­distinctive handwriting in 2003. It expresses sadness at the death of Lord Prescott s mother. The Prince opens by joking that he has been overdoing the quota of letters to the Deputy PM. Prince Charles with the Duchess of Cornwall at Ascot races last week does a lot of good for the country according to the former Labour minister Lord Prescott . But despite this – and the trouble the press would give him – he goes on to express his sadness and says his heart goes out to the politician. He added I did receive letters from the prince when I was in government but they had no effect on any policy. People say he should not be writing to ministers but he s quite entitled to express his opinion. Politicians are lobbied all the time by individuals and groups and none of them would allow a letter – even from Prince Charles – to unduly ­influence them. Prince Charles has long been accused of bombarding ministers with black spider memos attacking government policy. His letters are so named after his distinctive handwriting and abundant use of underlining and exclamation marks. Both Clarence House and the Prime Minister expressed disappointment after the court ruling. The notes reflect according to previous attorney general Dominic Grieve the prince s most deeply held personal views and beliefs .,"Labour peer John Prescott has defended Prince Charles over allegations he tries to secretly influence government policy with scrawled private notes to ministers insisting he should right to write as many damn letters as he likes .

We’ve made some exciting new changes to your Tinder profile including a slick new Instagram integration and more common friends. The firm said it made the changes after noticing many users put their Instagram user name in their profile. Now there’s no need to put your Instagram handle in your profile description to tell your story we got sick of having to do that too . It also stressed that the app would not let other visitors to your Instagram feed know it was part of a dating profile. And in case you were wondering Tinder won’t post anything to Instagram on your behalf or alter your existing Instagram privacy settings. Tinder has overhauled its profile as part of the Instagram integration and now shows friends of friends as well as more interests . The firm has also used Facebook to boost its mutual friends feature. Tinder now shows you the mutual friends and friends of friends you have in common with your potential matches. This adds more context and an extra degree of connection to every swipe Tinder claims. It is also preparing an overhaul of the way profiles look expanding the number of interests people can add. Earlier this month Tinder rolled out ‘Tinder Plus’ a premium service allowing people to ‘undo’ a like or change their location. A study has found that nearly two thirds of dating app users are men and one in five will pay for premium services. Sixteen to 34 year olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base. The study carried out by London based research firm GlobalWebIndex also found that six per cent of web users currently use a location based dating app. Significantly just a fifth of dating app users are paying for an online dating service co authors Jason Mander and Felim McGrath said in the report. But now they have set a limit on the number of ‘likes’ a user can perform in one day which seems to be set at 100. When a user reaches this limit the app tells them ‘You’re Out of Likes’ and gives a countdown clock until 24 hours are up so they can start swiping again. But below this clock a big red button says ‘Get Unlimited Likes with Tinder Plus’. A price is then shown. But different users are reporting the app is asking for different amounts. It seems the prices range from around GBP1.49 a month to as high as GBP14.99 but the reasons why are not clear. This means some users will pay GBP17.88 a year for Tinder Plus but others in the upper price category will have to fork out a whopping GBP179.88 a year. This equates to some users inadvertently paying GBP162 more than others over the course of a year. Speaking to MailOnline Rosette Pambakian Vice President of Communications and Branding at Tinder told MailOnline the app is testing out different price points ahead of a global release. We are testing Tinder Plus in select markets at various price points before rolling it out globally she said. The UK is one of our test markets so a certain portion of the population was given access to Tinder Plus at varying price points. However it is still not clear how the app decides how much to charge a user and whether it is based on location or activity. In addition Tinder has not commented on whether a user will receive a refund if they ultimately paid over the odds for the final price of the service.,"Tinder has added the ability to let people add their latest Instagram snaps to their profile.

Claims chemical signature proves James Ossuary was at Jerusalem site .
Chalk box bears inscription ‘James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus’
Find suggests Jesus fathered a child and was married .",An Israeli geologist claims he has ‘confirmed’ the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to Jesus and his son in Jerusalem. After extensive chemical tests Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary – a 1st century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of Jesus brother – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood. The research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place. Scroll down for video . After running 150 chemical tests an expert claims to have linked the James Ossuary pictured – a 1st century chalk box that was used for containing the bones of the dead – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood . According to geoarcheologist Dr Shimron the son of God was buried with nine other people including ‘Judah son of Jesus’ and his wife named Mary. Dr Shimron’s work has renewed controversy over the Talpiot tomb which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus The Jerusalem Post reported. Bones were discovered inside ossuaries including one that bore the inscription ‘Jesus son of Joseph . Others included the names Maria Joseph Mary Yose Matthew and most controversially ‘Judah son of Jesus’. Joseph Mary and Jesus were all common names at the time and a statistician from the University of Toronto said that they each made up eight per cent of the population. However a very small percentage would have had the same family name combination as described in the Bible. Dr Shimron’s work has renewed the controversy over the Talpiot tomb which was found in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus a portrait is pictured The long disputed long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood marked and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago . Probing this connection Dr Shimron and documentary maker Simcha Jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries including the James Ossuary which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription ‘James son of Joseph brother of Jesus’. The James Ossuary is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead. But it stands out because it bears the inscription James son of Joseph brother of Jesus on one side. The inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of Jesus . The existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002 but its authenticity was immediately challenged. The box s owner was charged with forging part of the inscription and while he was found innocent seven years later the judge said the acquittal does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2 000 years ago . Now Dr Shimron claims the chemical signature on the ‘crust’ of the box matches that of a tomb in Jerusalem known as the ‘Jesus Family tomb’ where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of Jesus and Mary as well as ‘Judah son of Jesus’. The owner of the ossuary Oded Golan was accused of forging the inscription shortly after its discovery by an academic from the Sorbonne in Paris but he was later found innocent. Other experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the Jerusalem tomb is connected with Jesus at all. Recently Dr Shimron gained access to the James Ossuary and scraped beneath the box s patina the layer that forms on metal over time. He ran around 150 tests on the chemistry of samples from 25 different ossuaries – 15 of which were from unrelated tombs – and found that traces of magnesium iron and silicon from the James Ossuary matched the chemical signature of Talpiot tomb. The Talpiot ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of ‘Rendzina’ soil which is characteristic of the hills of East Jerusalem when they were found and has a unique chemistry. Dr Shimron worked from the assumption that an earthquake of 363AD flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries effectively forming a vacuum and freezing them in time. Soil that seeped into the box matched that found in the Talpiot ossuaries indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the ‘holy’ location. Bones were discovered there in ossuaries or chalk boxes including one that bears the inscription ‘Jesus son of Joseph with others bearing the names of Maria Joseph Mary Yose Matthew and most controversially ‘Judah son of Jesus’. Here an inscription that says Yoseph on an ossuary . Because bones were found in the ossuaries it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection portrayed in this tapestry which is the belief of more traditional Christians while others accept the event was spiritual . Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals according to a writer and leading atheist activist. David Fitzgerald a San Francisco based author believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist. He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear. Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals according to a writer and leading atheist activist. A mosaic of Christ is shown . He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark Matthew and Luke claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus. Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence. Speaking to MailOnline he said There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years. Or it means he did not do all these things at all. The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray. I believe that Christianity started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old Gods and old traditions were rebooted. Christianity appears to have been a Jewish mystery faith. David Fitzgerald told MailOnline There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years . The famous statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro Brazil is shown . By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different Lord s suppers as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs. It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus. Mr Fitzgerald said There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person but I just do not think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all. We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time. There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria. During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus but all of them managed something Jesus did not to make a dent on the historical record. Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did. Jacobovici told The Jerusalem Post ‘This find illustrates that the James Ossuary is authentic and the Jesus Family tomb indeed belongs to the family of Jesus of Nazareth.’ Dr Shumron told The New York Times ‘I think I’ve got really powerful virtually unequivocal evidence that the James ossuary spent most of its lifetime or death time in the Talpiot Tomb.’ The retired senior researchers of the Geological Survey of Israel added ‘ The evidence is beyond what I expected.’ The duo are aware that the findings could rock the Christian church but insist the research is scientific and not theological. Because bones were found in the ossuaries it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection which is the belief of more traditional Christians while others accept the event was spiritual. The Talpiot tomb is now sealed under a concrete slab while the ossuaries found there are in the hands of the Israel Antiquities Authority. The James Ossuary is kept in a secret location by its owner who lives in Tel Aviv.,"An Israeli geologist claims he has ‘confirmed’ the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to Jesus and his son in Jerusalem.
After extensive chemical tests Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary – a 1st century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of Jesus brother – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood.
The research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place.

After running 150 chemical tests an expert claims to have linked the James Ossuary pictured – a 1st century chalk box that was used for containing the bones of the dead – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood .",An Israeli geologist claims he has ‘confirmed’ the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to Jesus and his son in Jerusalem. Dr Shimron’s work has renewed controversy over the Talpiot tomb which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus The Jerusalem Post reported. The inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of Jesus . Now Dr Shimron claims the chemical signature on the ‘crust’ of the box matches that of a tomb in Jerusalem known as the ‘Jesus Family tomb’ where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of Jesus and Mary as well as ‘Judah son of Jesus’. Recently Dr Shimron gained access to the James Ossuary and scraped beneath the box s patina the layer that forms on metal over time. Dr Shimron worked from the assumption that an earthquake of 363AD flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries effectively forming a vacuum and freezing them in time.

Several of her party's election pledges will overlap with Labour policies .
Others are calculated to drag a minority LAbour government to the left .
These include cancelling Trident and halting Tory changes to benefits .",Nicola Sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to ‘lead the UK’ as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor made for a power sharing deal with Labour. The SNP leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for British foreign policy welfare payments energy bills and English university tuition fees. Several of her election pledges overlap with Labour policy including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of GBP9 000 a year to GBP6 000 and rolling back competition in the English NHS. Others are calculated to drag a minority Labour government to the left including halting the roll out of Iain Duncan Smith’s popular changes to benefits and cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system. Scroll down for video . Control The Tories warn SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be Ed Miliband s puppet master if he becomes Prime Minister after the election . Several election pledges in Miss Sturgeon s manifesto overlap with Labour policy including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of GBP9 000 a year to GBP6 000 and rolling back competition in the English NHS . The SNP also wants the UK to formally recognise Palestine as a state give energy regulator Ofgem the power to force suppliers to cut prices and to increase public spending on infrastructure in northern England and Wales. At the heart of the SNP’s manifesto are plans for what Miss Sturgeon has called ‘modest’ spending increases funded by yet more borrowing – but which in fact total GBP180billion over five years. Scotland’s First Minister who is not herself running for a Westminster seat said yesterday the SNP had much in common with Left wing Labour MPs and aimed to build a ‘progressive alliance’ for people ‘right across the UK’. ‘There is an opportunity to build progressive alliances for progressive policies. It is a real rather than a pretend alternative to austerity ’ she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. Today’s SNP election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny. Polls suggest the party is on course for a landslide victory north of the border winning as many as 50 seats and holding the balance of power at Westminster. That could trigger constitutional turmoil of the sort that followed the 1910 election when Irish Nationalists surged and ended up with more than 70 seats. In the years that followed there was bitter conflict and the larger part of Ireland eventually seceded from the UK. The huge surge in support for the SNP could see senior Labour figures such as Jim Murphy left and Douglas Alexander right lose their seats . The latest Scotland wide YouGov survey shows the SNP on a record 49 per cent up three with Labour trailing on 25 per cent down four. The Conservatives were on 18 per cent and Liberal Democrats on just four per cent. The scale of the shift in traditional Labour strongholds in Scotland is unprecedented in modern European politics. Even senior Labour figures including the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and the shadow foreign secretary and the party’s election campaign coordinator Douglas Alexander are facing defeat. The SNP will declare today that a ‘strong team’ of SNP MPs in Westminster would help ‘rebalance the UK both politically and economically from the chronic over dominance of the City of London which has harmed the overall UK economy and left regions of England neglected’. Miss Sturgeon insisted those who had asked Scotland to remain in the UK in last year’s independence referendum could not now object to it calling the shots at Westminster. ‘We were told by leaders of the No campaign during the closing stages of the referendum debate that Scotland’s voice really mattered. Indeed we were told that Scotland shouldn’t leave the UK but lead the UK ’ she said. ‘So it is more than a bit rich now that Scotland has decided to remain part of the Westminster system for anyone in London or elsewhere to try and imply that Scotland’s voice shouldn’t be heard or that Scotland’s voice somehow becomes an illegitimate one if people here decide to elect a large number of SNP MPs.’ However the First Minister will face tough questions at today’s launch over her plans for ‘full fiscal autonomy’ or effective ‘home rule’ which would see almost every power apart from foreign affairs and defence devolved to Holyrood. It would end the generous Barnett Formula that funds Scotland. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has predicted that a ‘fiscally autonomous’ Scotland would have a GBP7.6billion black hole in its finances.,"Nicola Sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to ‘lead the UK’ as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor made for a power sharing deal with Labour.

Sturgeon has claimed that the SNP has “much in common with left-wing Labour MPs” and is aiming to build a “progressive alliance.” The SNP has been predicted to win a record 50 seats in the election, which could trigger constitutional turmoil. Sturgeon has also defended plans for “full fiscal autonomy” for Scotland, despite warnings from the Institute for Fiscal Studies over funding shortfalls.
","Nicola Sturgeon launches a bold campaign to influence UK leadership by proposing policies aligned with a potential Labour power-sharing deal, including changes in British foreign policy, welfare, energy bills, and English university tuition fees. Her manifesto overlaps significantly with Labour, proposing to reduce England's tuition fees from GBP9,000 to GBP6,000 and to scale back competition in the English NHS. Sturgeon aims to shift a minority Labour government leftwards, stopping the roll-out of popular benefits reform and scrapping the Trident nuclear weapons system. The SNP also advocates for the recognition of Palestine, empowering Ofgem to mandate price cuts by energy suppliers, and amplifying public infrastructure spending in northern England and Wales, embracing ""modest"" spending increases totaling GBP180 billion over five years through additional borrowing.

The robot would then have its purchase mailed to a group of artists who then put the items in an exhibition in the town of St Gallen in north east Switzerland. The Random Darknet Shopper purchased a number of items for sale on the deep web pictured including trainers jeans cigarettes a set of masterkeys and a DVD case far left containing 10 ecstasy tablets . The items it bought included a pair of Nike trainers counterfeit designer jeans the scan of a Hungarian passport and a set of UK Fire Brigade masterkeys. However it seems the Random Darknet Shopper crossed the line when it purchased 10 Ecstasy tablets which arrived in a vacuum packed bag hidden in a DVD case. The dark net is a subsection of the deep web the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines which are rather like dragging a net across the surface of the sea missing much of the information in the depths. The dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website and its successor that were recently shut down was used to sell drugs in exchange for bitcoins the electronic currency. Other dark net sites allow users to share pornographic photographs hacked information credit card numbers and other illegal goods. The Silk Road used an underground computer network known as the The Onion Router TOR which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption hiding the IP address and the activity of the user. Just 0.26 per cent of the daily internet traffic from the UK accesses this hidden part of the internet. Police seized the drugs the computer and the rest of the items it had purchased. Tests on the tablets later revealed they contained 90mg of the class A drug MDMA which the police then destroyed. The computer and the empty bag the ecstasy came in have now been returned to the group behind the bot !Mediengruppe Bitnik along with the other items it bought. They described the police s actions as an unjustified intervention into the freedom of art . Writing on their blog London based artists Carmen Weisskopf and Domagoj Smoljo who were behind the project said Random Darknet Shopper has finally been released and is now back in our possession. At the same time we also received the order for withdrawal of prosecution. In the order for withdrawal of prosecution the public prosecutor states that the possession of Ecstasy was indeed a reasonable means for the purpose of sparking public debate about questions related to the exhibition. The public prosecution also asserts that the overweighing interest in the questions raised by the art work Random Darknet Shopper justify the exhibition of the drugs as artefacts even if the exhibition does hold a small risk of endangerment of third parties through the drugs exhibited. We as well as the Random Darknet Shopper have been cleared of all charges. This is a great day for the bot for us and for freedom of art! The Random Darknet Shopper project was set up as an attempt to highlight some of the dilemmas that can be thrown up by dark net markets and anonymous internet use. It used Bitcoin to randomly purchase items that were offered for sail in the darknet. The tablets pictured above were sent from Germany inside a DVD case and a vacuum sealed foil bag . They were delivered to the artists by mail and then put on display in an exhibition at the Kunst Halle in St Gallen. During the weeks it had been running it also purchased a fake Louis Vuitton handbag a baseball cap with a hidden camera and 200 Chesterfield cigarettes. The darknet market features more than 16 000 items that are sold in a way that allows the seller to remain anonymous. The ecstasy tablets were found to contain 90mg of MDMA and were destroyed by the Swiss authorities . It has become notorious as a place to buy illegal pornography drugs and weapons. The robot software bought the ecstasy in October. It was sent from Germany to Switzerland and apparently crossed the border hidden in a DVD case without being intercepted by the authorities. The drugs were allowed to remain on show in the exhibition until it ended in January. However the police raided the exhibition when it came to an end and seized the computer and its purchases on the grounds the drugs were an endangerment of third parties. Speaking to the Guardian Mr Smoljo said that they had been told although the computer had purchased the drugs itself they were the legal owners of the drugs as they had executed the code behind the software. The case has raised important questions about the use of automatic shopping bots and the use of the darknet.

Lucrative Some dentists earn from multiple NHS contracts as well as private patients . Campaigners said the payments were ‘scandalous’ and ‘unacceptable’. Under freedom of information laws the NHS Business Services Authority was asked about the pensionable pay of dentists who do NHS work. In 2012/13 the latest figures available five practitioners were paid more than GBP500 000. They shared a total of about GBP3.4million – an average of GBP690 000. This comes on top of any money they take from treating patients privately.

Katherine Murphy of the Patients Association said the rates of pay were ‘exorbitant’. Yesterday s Daily Mail . She added ‘Investment is urgently needed on the front line where there is a desperate shortage of nurses and patients waiting for hours in A&E ... when the NHS is under such huge financial pressure this type of spending on huge salaries is unacceptable.’ It follows revelations in Thursday’s Mail that millions of pounds was being wasted on NHS prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Yesterday the Mail also exposed a GBP2 700 charge for cataract surgery at some hospitals – treble the cost to the health service – raising suspicions that patients are being ripped off. Patient Concern’s Roger Goss said ‘This is scandalous. People will be shocked to hear the sums lining dentists’ pockets when it is almost impossible to find dental care on the NHS in some parts of the country. ‘There is something strange going on when the NHS will pay for gastric bands suncream and hangover tablets yet it is so difficult to get dental treatment on it. It is almost perverse.’ Jonathan Isaby of the Taxpayers Alliance which the Mail commissioned to carry out the research said the salaries show a ‘shameless public sector elite taking taxpayers for a ride’. He added ‘It is outrageous that these telephone number salaries have been hidden from the people who pay them ... Taxpayers expect the money they put in to the NHS to be spent on patients not on bumper pay packets.’ The contracts brought in by Labour were designed to improve access to NHS dentistry. But patients are still struggling to get an appointment. The pay deals gave practitioners a fixed sum for a set amount of work agreed at the start of the year rather than separate incomes for the number of patients treated or procedures done. Thursday s Daily Mail . Treatments are divided into three bands from a simple check up earning the dentist GBP25 to procedures such as fitting dentures and crowns for roughly GBP300. The value of a contract can run to millions of pounds and some dentists run more than one practice so hold multiple contracts. According to the Health and Social Care Information Centre 21 500 dentists did NHS work in 2012/13 but most also do substantial amounts of private work. The British Dental Association’s Mick Armstrong said the top earning dentists ‘most likely own a group of practices’ or are specialists in their area. But Tory Charlotte Leslie who sat on the health select committee of MPs said ‘Most people will be absolutely stunned individual clinicians are getting such astronomical salaries on the NHS.’ A spokesman for NHS England said it contracts the vast majority of dental services from self employed individuals or companies some of whom ‘earn income from a number of contracts’.,"Britain s five highest earning NHS dentists are paid average salaries of GBP690 000 a year.

Boost for Osborne as he beats borrowing target by £3billion in last year .",Voters are still in the dark about the scale and depth of spending cuts being planned by all the main parties with just two weeks until polling day economic experts warned today. Analysts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said none of the major parties had given anything like full details on how they will tackle the nations debts after the election. The Tories were accused of giving no detail about their deficit reduction plan which relies on GBP30billion of cuts while Labour has left the door open to borrowing an extra GBP26billion a year. Scroll down for video . The Institute for Fiscal Studies analysed the policies of all the main parties to see how their policies would increase borrowing . The IFS warned that the promise of tackling the deficit in the next Parliament is based on almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases . The think tank reached its conclusions after a detailed study of the party manifestos ahead of May s General Election. It accused Tory Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls of failing to spell out exactly where the axe will fall. IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said There are genuinely big differences between the main parties fiscal plans. The electorate has a real choice although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice. Conservative plans involve a significantly larger reduction in borrowing and debt than Labour plans. But they are predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases. While Labour has been considerably less clear about its overall fiscal ambition its stated position appears to be consistent with little in the way of further spending cuts after this year. Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls are accused of not spelling out how they will tackle the deficit . George Osborne received a pre election boost today as official figures showed he beat his target for reducing annual public sector borrowing for the latest financial year by nearly GBP3 billion. Borrowing excluding the effect of bank bailouts was GBP87.3 billion for the year to the end of March down from GBP98.5 billion in 2013/14 according to the Office for National Statistics ONS . The result undershot the latest target of GBP90.2 billion set by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility OBR at the time of last month s Budget. It means that annual borrowing GDP has fallen by more than GBP60 billion from GBP153.5 billion in 2009/10 just before the Coalition came to power. As a percentage of gross domestic product GDP it has dropped by half from 10.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent. However underlying debt of GBP1.48 trillion is more than GBP500 billion higher than the 2009/10 figure of GBP956 billion. The nation s debt represents 80.4 per cent of GDP up from 62 per cent five years ago. The IFS analysis said the Tories planned the largest reduction in borrowing over the course of the next Parliament. It said the party would require large spending cuts or tax increases to achieve this. Research economist Soumaya Keynes said The Conservatives have said they want to eliminate the deficit but provided next to no detail on how they would do it. They should be forthcoming on the GBP5 billion of largely unspecified clampdown on tax avoidance the GBP10 billion of unspecified cuts to social security spending and according to our calculations further real cuts to unprotected departments of around GBP30 billion. Turning to Labour the IFS said the Opposition had been considerably more vague about how much it wants to borrow. The pledge to produce a surplus but without specifying by when or how much could be consistent with a reduction in borrowing totalling 3.6 per cent of national income. Senior research economist Rowena Crawford said Labour s proposed measures might be broadly enough to meet their target for only borrowing to invest. But this would leave borrowing at GBP26billion a year in today s terms. If Labour wanted to reduce borrowing to a lower level than this they would have to spell out more detail of how they would get there. The IFS said the Liberal Democrats had been more transparent about overall fiscal plans to 2017 18 revealing that they are aiming for a tightening more than Labour but less than the Conservatives. The SNP s figures imply the same reduction in borrowing as Labour the IFS said although the reduction would be slower. This means the SNP is proposing a slower but longer period of austerity the think tank said. The independent analysis came as the main parties clashed over the economy with Labour accusing the Tories of planning the biggest spending cuts in any of the world s advanced economies and the Conservatives renewing warnings that Britain s economy would suffer from an SNP/Miliband nightmare . Labour s Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said The IFS has confirmed that the Tories are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years. The Tories might be able to make the cuts but the last five years show they will fail to cut the deficit as they claim. They have borrowed GBP200 billion more than they planned because their failure to boost living standards has led to tax revenues falling short. But Mr Osborne today warned that every family in the country will be left GBP350 worse off if the SNP is left calling the shots in a Labour government. The Chancellor warned of a dangerous cocktail if Ed Miliband is at the mercy of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. With polls showing no party will win an overall majority Mr Osborne claimed it would spark a constitutional crisis if Scottish nationalist MPs held the balance of power in the UK government. Launching the SNP manifesto this week Ms Sturgeon named her price for supporting Labour in any post election deal. She demanded her MPs have a say over the running of the whole of the UK raising the prospect of Scottish nationalists calling the shots on policies which only apply south of the border. And she unveiled a GBP140billion ransom note for Britain to drag Labour to the left including an end to austerity rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Mr Miliband would have to pay for getting into Number 10. Mr Osborne seized on the demand for more spending and more borrowing and warned that Treasury analysis suggests it would add GBP6billion to Britain s interest bill worth GBP350 per family. Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4 s Today programme It s a new feature of this election that a Labour party cannot win an overall majority so they would rely on this deeply unstable block of Scottish Nationalists. We have got a strong plan for a national recovery but it s perfectly reasonable to point out with two weeks to go until this election the alternative is what Gordon Brown described last night as constitutional chaos . The Scottish Nationalist leaders would clearly be the stronger force in a Labour minority government propped up by them. Jonathan Isaby chief executive of the TaxPayers Alliance said The politicians seeking our votes owe it to taxpayers to come clean about what spending the country can and cannot afford. This candour has so far been noticeably absent in the election campaign with politicians failing to acknowledge the dire state of the public finances and instead clambering over each other to make additional and apparently unfunded spending pledges.

The Liberal Democrats have been more transparent about their plans and the SNP is proposing a slower but longer period of austerity.","Two weeks before polling day, economic experts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) have warned that voters are still largely unaware of the extent of spending cuts planned by the main political parties. The analysis shows that none of the parties have provided detailed plans on how they intend to address the nation's debts. The Tories' approach, which includes £30 billion in cuts, and Labour's potential for an extra £26 billion annual borrowing, were both critiqued for lack of specificity. The IFS study, examining party manifestos, concludes that all promises to reduce the deficit rely heavily on unspecified spending cuts and tax increases. Differences between the Conservative and Labour fiscal plans do exist, with the former aiming for a significantly larger reduction in borrowing and debt, albeit based on largely unknown spending cuts and tax increases, while Labour's plans are seen as less clear but consistent with minimal further spending cuts. The Liberal Democrats and SNP offer more transparency and a slower borrowing reduction, respectively. Amid these economic debates, both Conservatives and Labour have engaged in warnings against each other's plans, with the Tories highlighting the risks of SNP influence in a potential Labour government. The urgent need for clarity on spending and borrowing plans is underscored by concerns over the state of public finances and unfunded spending pledges.",analysts from the institute for fiscal studies said none of major parties had given anything like full details on how they will tackle the nations debts after the election. the tories accused of giving no detail about their deficit reduction plan which relies on gbp30billion of cuts while labour has left the door open to borrowing an extra gbp26billion a year.,"The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that none of the major parties have given full details on how they will tackle the nation's debts after the election.

So can our runner tell the difference?",Marathon season is in full swing with the London Marathon set to take place a week on Sunday. The long distance runners will inspire many to take up running and as the evening gets lighter and the weather gets warmer it s the perfect time to pull on your trainers and get fit. But what trainers should you go for Running is often celebrated as a budget sport because you do not have to pay expensive gym fees or buy lots of equipment. But trainers can be costly proved by the latest adidas Boost shoes that have gone on sale for GBP130. Femail writer and marathon runner Lucy Waterlow tested out GBP130 adidas Ultra Boost trainers against Aldi s budget GBP19.99 pair ahead of the London Marathon next week . In contrast supermarket chain Aldi have a running flash sale in stores from tomorrow Thursday with trainers available for the budget price of GBP19.99 while stocks last. The shoes you run in are important to prevent injuries and ensure you have a comfortable and enjoyable experience so can you really get the same results from a cheap supermarket pair over the costly version from a major sports brand FEMAIL asked Lucy Waterlow a marathoner with a personal best time of 3.06 and co writer of Nell McAndrew s Guide To Running to take them for a test run... THE TRAINERS . Adidas Ultra Boost GBP130 Adidas promise to deliver your greatest run ever with their new trainer which features their much hyped Boost technology. This is a type of cushioning that the sports brand have developed that looks like polystyrene and offers support and comfort to the wearer. Adidas say the Boost cushioning also gives energy return so the wearer can run more effortlessly. The adidas Boost technology is a type of cushioning that they say will deliver your greatest run ever while the Primeknit fabric is said to allow the natural expansion of any foot shape At GBP130 the shoes only offer value for money if you intend to run in them often but the bumpy undersole does not seem to be that durable . It certainly seems to have worked for the numerous elite athletes including Jessica Ennis who have worn Boost trainers thanks to sponsorship deals. Wilson Kipsang wore the adidas Adizero Adios version when he ran what was then a World Record time of 2 03 23 in Berlin in 2013. Speaking of the Ultra Boost version which have been on sale since February at a RRP of GBP130 adidas executive Eric Liedtke said Ultra BOOST represents the culmination of years of work and meticulous research striving to create the greatest running shoe ever. All of the very best in adidas technology has been combined to create a shoe that provides industry leading Energy Return alongside unprecedented adaptability and comfort. Aldi Premium Running Shoes GBP19.99 The premium running shoes are part of the Aldi s latest Specialbuys running range under the label Crane which will be in stores from 16th April and available while stocks last. It s not the first time Aldi have sold running trainers as a non premium version went on sale for GBP14.99 in 2013. Aldi s GBP19.99 premium running shoes for women comes in a turquoise and pink shade . The men s version is royal blue and will only be available in stores while stocks last . Aldi say their running range is high spec despite the low prices as they keep their costs down by stocking their own products over big brands having minimalist store interiors to reduce overheads and charging for plastic bags. The supermarket chain are not in the business of sponsoring elite athletes so can not lay claim to helping Olympians to medals or World Records with their shoes. LUCY S VERDICT APPEARANCE . Adidas The trainers come in black with purple embellishment for both men and women and are made using adidas Primeknit fabric which is said to allow the natural expansion of any foot shape. The dark colour makes a refreshing change for women who are often only offered running shoes in pink and pastel shades while the Primeknit fabric does look stylish and professional. The Boost cushioning encompasses the shoe a bit like a hovercraft so they do not make your feet look small and dainty. But while friends I met for a run did observe my feet looked big in the trainers they also admired the fashionable appearance of the shoe. Aldi The supermarket s trainers look the part and come in a bright turquoise and pink shade for women and royal blue for men. The appearance is reminiscent of Brooks popular Adrenaline running shoes so friends did not guess they were made by Aldi until I told them. The Aldi trainers feature reflective material which is great for being seen when running at night but the rest of the fabric used does look cheap. The outsole looks bulky and plastic so it does not look like it will have much give when running. LUCY S VERDICT FIT AND RUNNING FEEL . Adidas The shoes have a tongue at the back of the heel so they can be pulled on easily and the Primeknit fabric makes it feel you are putting your foot into a comfortable sock. The laces are sleek and elastic so can be easily tied for a snug fit. Adidas shoes can often come up small so it s advisable to buy a pair half a size larger than your usual shoe size. In doing so I found my pair to be a perfect fit. My toes had plenty of space at the front so they did not pinch when my foot pushed forward when I was running and they were not too lose at the heel so they did not rub. Often after trying new running shoes blisters can form but this wasn t the case even after a nine mile run in the shoes. The Boost cushioning gives a comfortable and springy feel and despite its bulky appearance the shoes do not feel too heavy on the foot while running. Lucy found the Boost trainers left fitted well and felt comfortable on a long run while the Aldi trainers right were adequate but felt bulkier and were not as snug a fit . Aldi The shoes are not available in half sizes so I opted for my usual shoe size despite this they still felt too big. I ran in the same running socks I had worn when running in the adidas trainers but felt I could have used a thicker pair in order for the shoes to fit better. The trainers were not a snug fit so I felt I had too much room around my forefoot and tightening the laces further did not help alleviate the roomy feel. Wearing thicker socks did help but I still felt my feet were sliding around a bit too much. However they did not rub so I again did not suffer from any blisters but they did feel less comfortable and were not as well fitted as the adidas pair. The trainers also felt heavier on my feet than the Boost. Overall they felt more sturdy then the adidas pair and I did not feel like they adapted to my feet in the same way running in them for a short run was fine but I would not feel comfortable wearing them for a long run or when doing speed work. LUCY S OVERALL VERDICT . To my surprise the Aldi shoes on the whole looked and felt the part although the fit wasn t ideal. I d recommend these to runners on a budget who are just starting out who may just be running two or three times a week and are not sure yet if they will stick with it. At GBP19.99 if you do not carry on running if your motivation wanes you will not be too much out of pocket. The supportiveness of the shoes also means they would be suitable to wear at the gym or for walking. However if you intend to carry on running I d recommend going to a specialist running shop to be fitted for a shoe exactly to your foot type. They can analyse your running style to see if you need any extra support. The adidas shoes felt comfortable and I was happy running in them for miles. Although they feel a little too bulky for speedwork they are great for steady runs and I would run a marathon in them. I am not convinced this Ultra Boost model is worth the GBP130 price tag though unless you can run in them often to get value for money. I am also not convinced that the unusual bumpy undersole they have will be that durable after just a few runs the rubber has shown signs of wear. What I convinced by was the cushioning provided by the Boost technology. But in the future I would be more likely to buy the Adizero Adios version for speedwork and racing as they are lighter in weight and not as expensive as their Ultra counterparts.,"Marathon season is in full swing with the London Marathon set to take place a week on Sunday.

Polls suggest neither Tories or Labour will manage to win a majority .
Fears the pound could fall another 10% if a badly hung parliament .",The pound has slipped to a five year low against the dollar amid growing uncertainty about the outcome of the general election. But the pound fell to near 1.46 against the US dollar its lowest level since June 2010 just after the last election when no party secured a majority. Different polls have variously put the Tories and Labour narrowly ahead with David Cameron and Ed Miliband both facing the prospect of having to rely on smaller parties to form a government. The pound fell to near 1.46 against the US dollar its lowest level since June 2010 just after the last election when no party secured a majority . Experts have warned of the impact on the economy of a badly hung parliament with neither major party able to form a stable government. There are fears it could sent pound plummeting by another 10 per cent. Today’s fall in the value of the pound was also impacted by figures showing industrial production grew by just 0.1 per cent in February. Construction shrank by 0.9 per cent following a 2.5 per cent contraction in January. It was suggested that the figures pointed to overall growth slowing to 0.4 per cent for the first quarter down from 0.6 per cent in the last three months of 2014. That would be the weakest pace of growth since the end of 2013. Labour have made gains in a series of opinion polls enjoying leads in three and cutting the Conservative lead in another. The latest survey also contains good news for the Liberal Democrats who gain three points to draw level with Ukip for the first time in more than 18 months. Based on the 2010 election result David Cameron needs to win another 23 more seats to secure a majority in the Commons while Ed Miliband needs at least 70. Nick Clegg is defending 56 seats but is braced for heavy losses . ComRes research for ITV and the Daily Mail suggested the race was still too tight to call with the Tories on 34 per cent and Labour on 33 per cent but that compared with a four point deficit for Ed Miliband s Opposition at the start of the campaign. Other polls gave Labour leads of between three and six points and one suggested that for the first time voters thought Ed Miliband was doing a better job than David Cameron. The Opposition gained two points on last week in the Survation poll for the Mirror while the Conservatives dipped one to move ahead by 35 per cent to 31 per cent. The Labour leader despite still trailing his Tory rival as the best to be prime minister by 37 per cent to 25 per cent will be delighted at their latest personal approval ratings after lagging consistently behind throughout most of his leadership. A hard hitting report by BlackRock the largest fund manager in the world said last week that ‘a soothing outcome for the markets is hard to imagine’ given Labour’s anti business policies and Tory plans to hold a referendum on Britain’ s membership of the European Union. ‘Labour would be tough on business – and might be perceived as lacking fiscal responsibility ’ the US giant said in the report. ‘A Conservatives dominated Cabinet would pave the way for an unsettling referendum in 2017 on the UK’s EU membership. ‘Whoever wins – and the result could take some time to emerge – will lead a weak government likely to pass only watered down legislation.’ BlackRock which invests in major British companies such as Tesco said weeks of horse trading to form a government would be ‘harrowing for the UK’.,"The pound has slipped to a five year low against the dollar amid growing uncertainty about the outcome of the general election.

There is an element in the community who are swayed by the US culture that guns are a right rather than a privilege Supt Plotecki told News Corp. Generally speaking however Australians do not have a strong gun culture and recent strong reaction against relaxing our gun ownership laws is indicative of this Australians do not want lax gun laws . He added that there did not appear to have been an increase in gun related crime that related to the increase in licences. Although the figures revealed that each person with a licence owns an average of 2.3 guns each the Firearm Registry s regulations suggest it s not easy to acquire a licence. Each request must include a genuine reason proved through supporting evidence with each reason in turn holding restrictions on the type of gun that can be owned.

A study found youngsters were more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them were distracted – with texting or talking on the phone a common cause. Researchers observed randomly selected parents with children who looked between 18 months and five years old at playgrounds in New York. Children are more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them are distracted by texting or talking on the phone the study showed file picture They measured factors such as the adult’s level of engagement with the child and how distracted they seemed. The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head first.

Electronic devices such as mobile phones were responsible for 30 per cent of all parental distractions. Three children fell while the researchers were observing them although none was seriously hurt. Study author Ruth Milanaik of Cohen Children’s Medical Centre in New York called on gadget obsessed parents to keep a closer eye on their offspring saying ‘Increased awareness of limiting electronic distractions and other activities that interfere with supervision should be considered.’ A neuroscientist claims that modern technology such as computer tablets and mobile phones could be changing the way our brains work . Professor Susan Greenfield warned that unless people wake up to the damage that the gadget filled pharmaceutically enhanced 21st century may be doing to our brains we could be sleepwalking towards a future in which neuro chip technology blurs the line between living and non living machines and between our bodies and the outside world. Electronic devices such as mobile phones and computer tablets could be anging the way our brains work according to a neuroscientist . She said One vital fact I have learnt is that the brain is not the unchanging organ that we might imagine. It not only goes on developing changing and in some tragic cases eventually deteriorating with age it is also substantially shaped by what we do to it and by the experience of daily life. When I say shaped I am not talking figuratively or metaphorically I am talking literally. At a microcellular level the infinitely complex network of nerve cells that make up the constituent parts of the brain actually change in response to certain experiences and stimuli. The brain in other words is malleable not just in early childhood but right up to early adulthood and in certain instances beyond. The surrounding environment has a huge impact both on the way our brains develop and how that brain is transformed into a unique human mind. Of course there s nothing new about that human brains have been changing adapting and developing in response to outside stimuli for centuries. But in the last century development of new technologies has increased dramatically. This will affect our brains over the next 100 years in ways we might never have imagined she said. Our brains are under the influence of an ever expanding world of new technology multichannel television video games MP3 players the internet wireless networks Bluetooth links the list goes on and on. This games driven generation interpret the world through screen shaped eyes. It s almost as if something has not really happened until it s been posted on Facebook Bebo or YouTube. We could be raising a hedonistic generation who live only in the thrill of the computer generated moment and are in distinct danger of detaching themselves from what the rest of us would consider the real world. Electronic devices and pharmaceutical drugs all have an impact on the micro cellular structure and complex biochemistry of our brains. And that in turn affects our personality our behaviour and our characteristics. In short the modern world could well be altering our human identity.,"Mobile phones and tablet computers are becoming dangerous distractions for parents who are supposed to be supervising their children researchers claim.

The Department for Education annulled the whole school s SAT s results after a probe by the local education authority file picture However he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers but to make them more legible. But the panel run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions.

Ibrahimovic and his PSG team mates including David Luiz pictured face Barcelona on Tuesday night . The Sweden international was suspended for the first leg after he was dismissed against Chelsea . At 33 Ibrahimovic is past caring what other people think of him. With an ego that makes Louis van Gaal look like a shrinking violet he will walk down the tunnel at the Nou Camp convinced in his own mind that Messi Neymar and Luis Suarez will be in awe of him. When asked to name a dream team of team mates he d played with he named himself up front with Messi – ahead of Thierry Henry and Alessandro del Piero. Football is not something you plan in advance. It just happens he says. His 30 yard propellor kick for Sweden against England is rated by Steven Gerrard as the greatest goal he s ever seen. To be fair Ibrahimovic s CV allows him plenty of bragging rights. The Swede with Bosnian roots has played for Ajax Juventus Barcelona and both Milan giants. He once won eight league titles in a row. Not bad for a poor kid whose immigrant parents moved to the roughest part of Malmo. Now he s trying to make new history with PSG. He was the marquee signing when Qatari owners bought the Paris side and decided to try and turn it into Europe s greatest football club. They agreed to pay him GBP200 000 a week even though France s 75 per cent top tax rate meant their total bill would be close to GBP50million a year. Not that Ibrahimovic is that overly grateful. He recently called France a s**t country and had to apologise in a rare burst of self awareness. Despite domestic dominance Champions League glory has remained elusive so far. Ibrahimovic has never won the trophy as a player and his bad luck in the competition continued when he was harshly sent off in the previous round against Chelsea and was therefore suspended for the first leg against Barca.

For Paris to pull off one of European football s greatest comebacks Zlatan and Marco Verratti will have to excel. Ibrahimovic undoubtedly has the talent to produce a flash of brilliance or two to put Luis Enrique s men under pressure. His balletic left footed back heel while on the rise for Sweden against Italy at Euro 2004 was a goal very few players could have scored. His famous strike against England silenced those who wondered why he could never produce against British clubs. Against Barcelona Ibra will have special motivation. He spent a season at the Nou Camp in 2009/10. It should have been the perfect stage for his talents but he moved to Inter Milan after just a year. Ibrahimovic spent just one season at the Nou Camp before moving to Serie A giants Inter Milan . He felt Messi s insistence on playing more centrally inhibited his own game and that coach Pep Guardiola wasn t strong enough to devise a system that could incorporate both of them.

For months she would suffer swelling, feel exhausted, and faint .
Thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus .
Tests suggested she had high levels of mercury due to amalgam fillings .",Jameela spent GBP3 000 on having all her amalgam fillings removed and replaced with white fillings . Jameela Jamil has the dazzling smile that you d expect of a television presenter and former model. Yet the 29 year old broadcaster is convinced her teeth or rather the dental work done on them triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years. From the age of 21 I would wake up in the morning with a puffy swollen face feeling utterly hungover even though I do not drink says Jameela who has presented the Radio 1 Chart Show and programmes for Channel 4. My head felt heavy and I was permanently exhausted. Occasionally I would even faint. There were days when I d arrive at work and the make up artists would send me home because I just looked awful and felt terrible. After several months of this she went to a private doctor who referred her for tests. Jameela thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus an auto immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body. In fact the tests suggested she had high levels of mercury. After other potential causes such as diet were ruled out it was suggested the problem was down to the ten amalgam fillings she d had as a child. So she spent GBP3 000 on having them all removed and replaced with white fillings. Dental amalgam has been used for more than 150 years and every year 12 million fillings made from it are given to patients in Britain. Amalgam remains a standard material to use especially on back teeth because it is particularly robust. It is made from a mixture of metals including silver tin and copper. Liquid mercury is used to help mix these components together. Breathing in extremely high concentrations of mercury can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia and affect the central nervous system causing muscle tremors. Long term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys. But mercury poisoning is very rare suggests Dr Prem Mahendra a consultant haematologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham. In 27 years as a haematologist I have never been asked to test for mercury he says. Dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed the mercury can release vapour. This is absorbed into the bloodstream in the lungs and then taken to the kidneys to be passed out harmlessly in the urine. Blood tests showed she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels her fillings were pinpointed as the cause . But the amounts taken in from fillings is minuscule says Salford dentist Dr Ben Atkins. Indeed a review by the EU Commission s Scientific Committee in 2008 concluded there was no risk from amalgam says Professor Damien Walmsley the British Dental Association s scientific adviser. Amalgam is strong durable and adaptable and there is no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use adds StJohn Crean professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of Central Lancashire. It is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth 5 per cent of the population react to contact with amalgams in this way but this poses no risk to health adds Professor Walmsley. And yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway because of patient concern about the risk. Finland and Japan have restrictions on its use with a view to phasing it out. This follows research linking mercury to certain diseases. A 2012 review of 106 studies published in the Journal of Alzheimer s Disease suggested mercury from amalgams could be a contributing factor to the condition. But fillings are not the only source of mercury. It can get into the blood through food nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces though the Food Standards Agency says this is not a concern for most people. However some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that could harm an unborn baby or young child s developing nervous system. That s why young children and women planning to have a baby or who are already pregnant or breastfeeding are advised to avoid fish that can have higher levels of mercury such as shark swordfish and marlin. Pregnant women are advised to limit their tuna to no more than two steaks or four medium sized cans a week. And yet dental amalgam pictured posed by model is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway because of patient concern about the risk . But Jameela does not eat fish so knew the mercury levels could not be due to her diet. She s allergic to peanuts shellfish and dairy foods and at 12 was diagnosed with coeliac disease a condition which causes an adverse reaction to gluten found in wheat barley and rye. Following blood tests it was discovered that she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels her fillings were pinpointed as the cause. All I could think of was I had to get rid of them says Jameela. But while she expected her symptoms to immediately subside once her fillings were removed they continued to affect her over the next few years. I hated the fatigue the headaches the fact I should have been fit and healthy but felt rotten all the time Jameela says. I read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system. I think that the mercury was affecting my immune and digestive system. Dentist Dr Atkins has spoken to many patients who have wanted to have their silver fillings removed because they are concerned about the potential health issues. But he warns that removing amalgams can do more harm than good as more vapour can be inhaled into the system by doing this. Aside from the fact there is no evidence to suggest amalgams are anything other than safe every time a dentist drills a tooth they remove a little dental tissue. So you are essentially damaging the tooth he says. The number of fillings in the average adult s mouth . Still struggling Jameela saw a nutritionist who recommended drinking solutions made from clay and algae chlorella three times a day. These apparently bind to mercury and help remove it. She did this for two years and tried various diets to tackle the inflammation linked to the mercury that was making her ill. For my 25th birthday my flatmate gave me a piece of melon with a candle in it cake was out of the question she says. It took about a year before I started to feel better. It s all had a massive impact on my life. However Anton Emmanuel consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital London is not convinced mercury could affect digestion in this way. You would have to be exposed to massive overdoses of mercury for the gut to be affected he says. Not in the level or forms that you get with mercury fillings. In fact I see patients whose gut symptoms ironically seem to be caused by the stress and anxiety of thinking that it is their mercury fillings which are causing stomach problems when there is no physical sign of any gut disorders. But Jameela remains convinced that the mercury was the cause of her problems. There is so much we do not know about amalgam fillings. I know I feel much better now she says. Private clinics offer mercury testing. But Dr Mahendra says anyone thinking of having this done should check that the clinic s laboratories have clinical pathology accreditation CPA to ensure that the tests are carried out properly.

The ""smart bullets"" can help shooters compensate for high winds .
The goal of  the program is to give shooters greater range and make American troops safer .",CNN You know the phrase dodging a bullet Forget about it. Probably not going to happen anymore. The U.S. military said this week it has made great progress in its effort to develop a self steering bullet. In February the smart bullets .50 caliber projectiles equipped with optical sensors passed their most successful round of live fire tests to date according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA. In the tests an experienced marksman repeatedly hit moving and evading targets a DARPA statement said. Additionally the statement said a novice shooter using the system for the first time hit a moving target. In other words now you do not even have to be a good shot to hit the mark. The system has been developed by DARPA s Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance program known as EXACTO. True to DARPA s mission EXACTO has demonstrated what was once thought impossible the continuous guidance of a small caliber bullet to target said Jerome Dunn DARPA program manager. This live fire demonstration from a standard rifle showed that EXACTO is able to hit moving and evading targets with extreme accuracy at sniper ranges unachievable with traditional rounds. Fitting EXACTO s guidance capabilities into a small .50 caliber size is a major breakthrough and opens the door to what could be possible in future guided projectiles across all calibers Dunn said. Videos supplied by DARPA show the bullets making sharp turns in midair as they pursue their targets. It all conjures up images of a cartoon character frantically fleeing a bullet that follows him wherever he goes. Only these bullets are traveling at hundreds of miles per hour. And even the Road Runner can not run that fast. DARPA says the smart bullets will also help shooters who are trying for example to hit targets in high winds. The goals of the EXACTO program are giving shooters accuracy at greater distances engaging targets sooner and enhancing the safety of American troops DARPA said.,"CNN You know the phrase dodging a bullet Forget about it.
